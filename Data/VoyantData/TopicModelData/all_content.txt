Summary
Introduction
In April 2013, the Government brought in reforms to civil litigation funding and costs in England and Wales. These concerned the way that civil cases are funded, and the costs involved in bringing those cases. These reforms were in part as a result of changes in legislation (Part 2 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 - 'the LASPO Act') which came into effect on 1 April 2013.
The reforms apply across civil litigation, but have a particular impact in personal injury cases, where no win no fee conditional fee agreements (CFAs) are used significantly.
The main changes are summarised below, and some of the issues are explained in more detail under the Main changes page . It should be noted that this is intended as a brief summary of the changes, which are set out in the primary legislation - the LASPO Act - and secondary legislation including the Civil Procedure Rules .
The summary here does not have any legal status; it will be necessary to consult the legislation for details of the new provisions.
Summary of key changes
No win no fee CFAs remain available in civil cases, but the additional costs involved (success fee and insurance premiums) are no longer payable by the losing side.
No win no fee damages based agreements (DBAs) are available in civil litigation for the first time.
Referral fees are banned in personal injury cases.
The introduction of new protocols extending the Road Traffic Act personal injury scheme to £25,000.
A new fixed recoverable costs (FRC) regime.
Claimants' damages are protected: the fee that a successful claimant has to pay the lawyer - the lawyer's 'success fee' in CFAs, or 'payment' in DBAs - is capped at 25% of the damages recovered, excluding damages for future care and loss
General damages for non-pecuniary loss such as pain, suffering and loss of amenity are increased by 10%
A new regime of 'qualified one way costs shifting' (QOCS) is introduced in personal injury cases which caps the amount that claimants may have to pay to defendants.  Claimants who lose, but whose claims are conducted in accordance with the rules, are protected from having to pay the defendants costs.
A new sanction on defendants to encourage earlier settlement of claims.

Wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice
The Criminal Cases Review Commission is an independent public body that was set up in March 1997 by the 1995 Criminal Appeal Act. Our purpose is to review possible miscarriages of justice in the criminal courts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and refer appropriate cases to the appeal courts.
The Commission assesses whether convictions or sentences should be referred to a court of appeal
The Commission is based in Birmingham and has about 100 staff, including a core of about 50 caseworkers, supported by administrative staff.
There are nine Commissioners, appointed in accordance with the Office for the Commissioner for Public Appointments’ Code of Practice. They work with the Senior Management Team to ensure the Commission runs efficiently.
We are completely independent and impartial and do not represent the prosecution or the defence.
Our Vision
To enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system, to give hope and bring justice to those wrongly convicted, and based on our experience to contribute to reform and improvements in the law
Our Values

Bills and legislation
Issue
Any amount of crime in society is unacceptable. Not just because of the human cost, but also the cost to society.
Actions
We have a new approach to fighting crime that involves a shift of power from Whitehall to local communities. The police will be given far greater freedom to do their jobs, and the public more power to hold them to account.
We will judge our success on whether crime has fallen.
We’re reducing crime by:
creating community triggers to deal with persistent antisocial behaviour
using community safety partnerships and police and crime commissioners, to work out local approaches to deal with issues, including antisocial behaviour, drug or alcohol misuse and re-offending
establishing the national referral mechanism to make it easier for all the different agencies that could be involved in a trafficking case to cooperate, share information about potential victims and get access to advice, accommodation and support
creating street-level crime maps to give the public up-to-date, accurate information on what is happening on their streets so they can challenge the police on performance
And we’re trying to prevent crime by:
creating the child sex offender disclosure scheme , which allows anyone concerned about a child to find out if someone in their life has a record for child sexual offences
legislating against hate crime
using football banning orders to stop potential troublemakers from travelling to football matches - both at home and abroad
legislating to stop cash payments to buy scrap metal and reforming the regulation of the scrap metal industry to prevent unscrupulous dealers buying stolen metal
Background
Our new approach to fighting crime is informed by, among others, the following:
‘A new approach to fighting crime’ (March 2011) - the police and their partners will be given far greater freedom to do their jobs and use their discretion
‘Putting victims first: more effective responses to anti-social behaviour’ (May 2012) - this white paper sets out our plans to introduce more effective measures to tackle antisocial behaviour
Community Remedy consultation (December 2012) - this consultation asked for views on proposals to introduce legislation to allow police and crime commissioners (or the relevant local policing body) to give victims of low-level crime (such as low-level criminal damage and low-value thefts) and antisocial behaviour a say in the punishment of the offender
Bills and legislation
The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act received royal assent in March 2014.
The act has introduced simpler, more effective powers to tackle anti-social behaviour and better protection for victims and communities, including :
tackling the use of illegal firearms by gangs and organised criminal groups
stopping irresponsible dog ownership
strengthening the protection afforded to the victims of forced marriage and those at risk of sexual harm
amending the port and border security powers in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000

Legal aid for family matters
You may be able to get legal aid to help with some family matters, however you will need to provide a solicitor with evidence that you are entitled to legal aid. The following guidance explains the steps you will need to take to get that evidence:
If you are a victim of domestic violence and are divorcing or separating from an abusive partner
You can get legal aid to help with the divorce or things such as child contact or how to share money or property, but you will need to give your solicitor some evidence that you have been a victim of domestic violence by your partner.
When a child is at risk of abuse from a partner
You can get legal aid to help with issues such as child contact or removal of a father’s or mother's parental responsibility, but you must be able to give your solicitor some evidence that the child is at risk of abuse.
Template letters
If you have been asked to provide evidence to help with a legal aid application, then you can use the following template letters to help provide that evidence in the appropriate form if you are:

Accessing the Justice Data Lab service
From:
Information provided to organisations supporting the rehabilitation of offenders.
Documents
PDF , 353KB, 44 pages
Detail
The Justice Data Lab pilot gives organisations working with offenders access to central reoffending data. The service provides this information to help organisations to assess the impact of their work on reducing reoffending. It also helps develop a collaborative understanding of effective rehabilitation.
To use the service, complete the ‘data upload template’ with details of the individuals your organisation has worked with, and information about the services provided. The template must be sent by secure email (gsi or CJSM).
If the information in the ‘data upload template’ meets the minimum criteria, the Justice Data Lab will provide an analysis which assesses the impact of that programme against various reoffending measures (including the 1 year proven reoffending rate and the frequency of reoffending over the 1 year). The results will be returned in a clear and easy to understand format, with explanations of the key metrics, and any caveats and limitations needed to interpret the results.
See all results published so far at: Justice Data Lab pilot statistics reports
Update on the Justice Data Lab service – October 2014
The Justice Data Lab team have started bringing the 2012 reoffending data into the service. You can now submit information on the individuals you were working with during 2012, in addition to the years 2002 to 2011. The Justice Data Lab has made a commitment to bringing underlying reoffending data into the service more regularly. If you have any questions about the latest available data email a member of the team.

Human Rights
The 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a binding international agreement that the UK helped draft and has sought to comply with for over half a century. However, for many years the Convention was not a full part of our own law, so using the Convention usually meant taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. This was often time-consuming and expensive.
Since coming into force on 2 October 2000, the Human Rights Act (HRA) has made rights from the ECHR (the Convention rights) enforceable in our own courts. The Act works in three key ways:
First, it requires all legislation to be interpreted and given effect as far as possible compatibly with the Convention rights. Where it is not possible to do so, a court may quash or disapply subordinate legislation (such as Regulations or Orders), but only Parliament can make changes to primary legislation (such as Acts of Parliament).
Second, it makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with the Convention rights and allows for a case to be brought in a UK court or tribunal against the authority if it does so. However, a public authority will not have acted unlawfully under the Act if as the result of a provision of primary legislation (such as another Act of Parliament) it could not have acted differently. In general, a person who wants to take the UK to the ECtHR must first bring their case before our domestic courts.
Third, UK courts and tribunals must take account of Convention rights in all cases that come before them. This means, for example, that they must develop the common law compatibly with the Convention rights, taking account of Strasbourg case law.
Public authorities and human rights
The guidance for public authorities consists of:
Making sense of human rights - a short introduction: this guide is designed for officials in public authorities to assist them in working with the Human Rights Act 1998. It gives a brief introduction to human rights for use in straightforward situations.
The printed version of this guide also came with a DVD: Human rights, human Lives: how the Human Rights Act influences the public sector.

Other guidance
Human Rights Act for regulators and inspectorates
A handbook designed to support people working at all levels within regulatory bodies and inspectorates to meet their own legal obligations and to ensure that public services meet the needs of individual service users. It shows how to use human rights to make decisions about complex problems and to design regulatory and inspection frameworks, with case studies of bodies that have done so.

Out-of-court disposals
Out-of-court disposals allow the police to deal quickly and proportionately with low-level, often first-time offending which does not merit prosecution at court.
This allows the police to spend more time on frontline duties and tackling serious crime.
It is important that out-of-court disposals are used appropriately and that their use is understood by practitioners and the following is a set of revised and strengthened guidance to support this.

Transforming rehabilitation
Transforming Rehabilitation is a reform programme that is changing the way offenders are managed in the community to bring down reoffending rates while continuing to protect the public.
Our reforms will:
Open up the market to a diverse range of rehabilitation providers from the private, voluntary and social sectors (including potential mutuals);
Incentivise innovation, paying providers by results for delivering reductions in reoffending;
Extend statutory rehabilitation to 45,000 short sentenced offenders released from prison every year, who have the highest reoffending rates and yet currently receive no supervision after release;
Reorganise our prisons to resettle offenders ‘through the gate’, with continuous support from custody to community;
Create a new public sector National Probation Service, to manage high risk offenders.
You can sign up to receive updates about Transforming Rehabilitation.
Full details of the reform plans are set out in the government’s consultation response Transforming Rehabilitation: A Strategy for Reform . Transforming Rehabilitation is driven by the Ministry of Justice and Home Office’s Reducing reoffending and improving rehabilitation policy .
Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014
On 13 March 2014, the Offender Rehabilitation Bill received Royal Assent.
The new Act means that for the first time virtually all offenders will receive at least 12 months supervision in the community on release from custody.
The provisions in the Act will be implemented as part of the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms.
The Act and explanatory notes can be downloaded from the UK Parliament website.
Supporting documentation including the impact assessment is on the gov.uk website.

Revenge porn: understanding the issues
Revenge porn refers to the the distribution of images usually, but not exclusively, shared online or via other digital means which are sexually explicit or involve nudity, without the consent of the person depicted and with the intention of causing distress to that person.
The Government is keen to understand more about the scale of this issue, whether incidents are being reported and, where they are, how these are being dealt with. This will allow us to understand whether more needs to be done to address the problem.
We want to hear from the public, from charities and support organisations and from web and digital companies whose products may be used to distribute images and from the authorities, such as the police, who work with the public and who may need to deal with reports of this type.
To discuss these issues, we're holding a webchat on 2 September from 2:30 to 4:30pm, hosted by policy officials working in this area. The page will open at midday on 1 September for pre-submitted questions and comments.

The scope of this consultation
From September 2015, students in England will start studying for new GCSE English language qualifications, graded 9 to 1. We have already announced that the outcomes of the assessment of students' speaking skills will not contribute to the 9 to 1 grade for the subject. This grade will be based on students' performance in their written exams only. Students' performance in their spoken language assessment will instead be reported in a separate grade. We are now seeking views on how the spoken language assessment should be conducted, marked and graded.

Tax and Chancery (Upper Tribunal) guidance
The Upper Tribunal is a Superior Court of Record. The Tax and Chancery Chamber has UK wide jurisdiction in tax cases and references against decisions of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Pensions Regulator; for Charity and Land Registration cases its jurisdiction extends to England and Wales. The chamber also has the power of judicial review in certain instances.
The Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) aims to assist those wishing to appeal against, or involved in decisions of the First–tier Tribunal in Tax, Charity and from 1 July 2013 Land Registration cases. It also aims to assist people wishing to refer matters relating to certain decisions of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Pensions Regulator.
The Tax and Chancery Chamber also has the power to judicially review decisions in certain circumstances.

Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (REMIT)
As of 29 June 2013 when the Great Britain Remit Regulations came into place the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) has had the power to deal with appeals against decisions in the following jurisdiction:
Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) - this Jurisdiction hears and decides appeals against decisions issued by Ofgem as part of their plans to implement the EU regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency.
Please read the guidance which explains the process.
Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013 –right to refer NIAUR decisions to Upper Tribunal
EU Regulation 1227/2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (known as 'REMIT'), aims to create an efficient and effective oversight framework for Europe’s wholesale electricity and gas markets.  The EU Regulation requires member states to put in place a proportionate and dissuasive penalty regime to deter wrong doing.
This regime was put in place for Northern Ireland by the introduction of  Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013 which came into force on 31 August 2013.  These Regulations mirror the Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc) 2013 introduced for England, Scotland and Wales.
Under the Electricity and Gas (Market Integrity and Transparency) (Enforcement etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013, the Northern Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) have be given investigatory powers to ensure they can investigate any suspected REMIT breach. NIAUR will also have the power to impose penalties for a breach of a REMIT requirement and/or require restitution.
Before taking action against any person, NIAUR must first issue a decision notice to that person. Under the Regulations, the person has the right to refer the matter to the Upper Tribunal
Please read the Rules for further information.
Making an appeal, application or reference
In tax, land registration and charity appeals you must apply to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal before you fill in any forms. Please refer to the guidance you would have received on how to appeal.
The Tribunal’s permission is not required to bring a reference to the Upper Tribunal against a decision of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Pensions Regulator or an Independent Valuer.
Information leaflets are available to help you to appeal or make a reference to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber). Please note that, in an appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal, in the first instance, you will need to ask the First-tier Tribunal judge for permission to appeal.
Tax, Charity and Land Registration applications and appeals
The Tax and Chancery Chamber decides applications for permission to appeal and appeals on points of law from decisions of the First-tier Tribunal in tax, charity and Land Registration cases. In Land Registration cases it is also possible to appeal against the Tribunal’s decision on the facts in limited circumstances. In tax and charity cases it also has a limited first-instance jurisdiction if cases are transferred from the First-tier Tribunal.
Financial Services cases
The Upper Tribunal also hears references arising from decision notices issued by the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Pensions Regulator. The decision notices may cover a wide range of regulatory and disciplinary matters.
The firm or the individual to whom the notice is directed has the right to refer the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Tribunal determines what the appropriate action is for the Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Authority or the Pensions Regulator to take.
References against decisions of the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority

HM Courts & Tribunals Service was created on 1 April 2011. It brings together HM Courts Service & Tribunals Service into one integrated agency providing support for the administration of justice in courts and tribunals.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service is an agency of the Ministry of Justice. It uniquely operates as a partnership between the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals as set out in our Framework Document.
The agency is responsible for the administration of the criminal, civil and family courts and tribunals in England and Wales and non-devolved tribunals in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It provides for a fair, efficient and effective justice system delivered by an independent judiciary.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service aims to ensure that all citizens receive timely access to justice according to their different needs, whether as victims or witnesses of crime, defendants accused of crimes, consumers in debt, children at risk of harm, businesses involved in commercial disputes or as individuals asserting their employment rights or challenging the decisions of government bodies.
From April 2011 the agency employs 21,000 staff operating from around 650 locations. It has a gross annual budget of around 1.7bn, approximately 585m of which is recovered in fees and income from service users. It handles over 2 million criminal cases, 1.8 million civil claims, more than 150,000 family law disputes and almost 800,000 tribunal cases annually.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service works with a range of Government departments and justice agencies to ensure access to justice is provided in the most timely and effective way possible.
The agency's work is overseen by a Board headed by an independent Chair working with non-executive, executive and judicial members. The Board ensures that the agency delivers the aims and objectives set by the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals.
History of tribunals reforms
Welsh Language
We have adopted the principle that in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales we will treat the Welsh and English languages on a basis of equality. Our Welsh Language Scheme sets out how HM Courts & Tribunals Service will give effect to that principle when providing services to the public in Wales.

This part of the Ofqual website has been designed to give you easier access to respond to our consultations and is open to allow anyone to comment on the work that we do. Each open consultation allows you to respond to as many or as few parts of the document as you wish, meaning that if you are only interested in an aspect of the consultation you can respond to that bit alone.
Consultations
Ofqual is committed to effective consultation; consultation which is targeted at, and easily accessible. In line with the Government’s Code of Practice on Consultation , Ofqual supports the seven criteria:
Formal consultation should take place at a stage when there is scope to influence the policy outcome.
Consultations should normally last for at least 12 weeks with consideration given to longer timescales where feasible and sensible.
Consultation documents should be clear about the consultation process, what is being proposed, the scope to influence and the expected costs and benefits of the proposals.
Consultation exercises should be designed to be accessible to, and clearly targeted at, those people the exercise is intended to reach.
Keeping the burden of consultation to a minimum is essential if consultations are to be effective and if consultees’ buy-in to the process is to be obtained.
Consultation responses should be analysed carefully and clear feedback should be provided to participants following the consultation.
Officials running consultations should seek guidance in how to run an effective consultation exercise and share what they have learned from the experience.
Commenting
We are offering you the opportunity to comment on these consultations and in doing so we'd like you to be aware that we will not usually delete comments so long as you keep within the commenting guidelines below. We will never edit comments that you leave.

Fraud
From time to time fraudsters try to use the Ministry of Justice identity in an attempt to steal money from consumers. The most common types of scams are detailed below.
If you believe you have been a victim of this scam you should report the matter to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or via the website .
Your reports will then be passed on to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau and analysed to see if they can be used as part of a police investigation.
You can help to stop scammers by warning your friends and family, and by making Action Fraud aware of any scams that you have encountered.
Telephone scams
We are aware of several scams including:
A scam where a telephone caller claims to be calling from a court and tells you that you have only a few days to avoid attending a court hearing and a fine of £5000, but you can avoid this by making a smaller payment to them immediately over the phone. This is not how the UK courts operate.
If a real court hearing was to take place you would be informed formally in writing and given sufficient notice for you to obtain advice before attending. Her Majesty’s Courts & Tribunals Service would never make unsolicited phone calls, demand money in advance to prevent a court hearing from taking place, or seek payment through cash vouchers bought in local shops.
A scam involving a telephone call from someone claiming to be from the Ministry of Justice or other government department. These callers usually have strong foreign accents and use fake anglicised names. Consumers are typically told that they are eligible to receive payments such as the repayment of bank charges or tax, compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), or other debts.
Consumers are asked to provide personal information, such as bank account details and make an upfront payment, often by one of the following methods:
Money Transfer: Payment can be requested via Western Union or the Post Office’s MoneyGram® service.
Ukash Vouchers: Consumers are asked to purchase cash vouchers through a local high street shop and use the reference code to send the payment by email or over the telephone. If you have been a victim and paid money via the Ukash voucher scheme, contact UKash immediately on 0808 234 6244 (open 24 hours) to see if the payment can be blocked. For further information see the warnings on the Ukash website .
Paysafecard: Consumers are asked to purchase payment cards through a local high street shop and use the reference code to send the payment by email or over the telephone. If you have been a victim and paid money via Paysafecard, contact the company immediately on 0845 021 3059 (open 24 hours) to see if the payment can be blocked. For further information see the Paysafecard website .
Bank Transfer or Debit and Credit Cards: Scammers sometimes ask consumers to provide their bank or card details in order for them to withdraw payment. If you have already given out these details, you should contact your bank or card provider immediately to stop or check any unauthorised transactions.
These callers have no connection with the Ministry of Justice, or other genuine organisations.
They may already have some of your personal data, such as your name, address or bank details and may try to obtain more in order to commit identity theft. Do not pay any money unless you receive formal written information first and are absolutely confident the organisation involved is legitimate. Consumers are warned not to pass on personal or financial details to these callers.
Illegal use of Ministry of Justice identity and logos
In some scams fraudsters may falsely claim to be linked to the Ministry of Justice, or use the official logo or that of one of our agencies as letterhead to add authenticity to obtain bank or credit card details. Similar scams may involve the use of logos from other legitimate organisations, like the Metropolitan Police or the Office of Fair Trading.
In addition to using the logo illegitimately, fraudsters may use an email link to draw any potential victim further into the scam. The email address may appear to be similar to a legitimate Ministry of Justice internet link.
The Ministry of Justice takes seriously any attempt to misappropriate its identity or that of its agencies, associated offices and official logo's and will investigate any such incidents of misuse and take appropriate action where necessary.
Any correspondence, like letters or emails with Ministry of Justice identity that request private information, should be treated with extreme caution. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of such communications, please contact us on 020 3334 3555 or by email: general.queries@justice.gsi.gov.uk

Human Rights
The 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a binding international agreement that the UK helped draft and has sought to comply with for over half a century. However, for many years the Convention was not a full part of our own law, so using the Convention usually meant taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. This was often time-consuming and expensive.
Since coming into force on 2 October 2000, the Human Rights Act (HRA) has made rights from the ECHR (the Convention rights) enforceable in our own courts. The Act works in three key ways:
First, it requires all legislation to be interpreted and given effect as far as possible compatibly with the Convention rights. Where it is not possible to do so, a court may quash or disapply subordinate legislation (such as Regulations or Orders), but only Parliament can make changes to primary legislation (such as Acts of Parliament).
Second, it makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with the Convention rights and allows for a case to be brought in a UK court or tribunal against the authority if it does so. However, a public authority will not have acted unlawfully under the Act if as the result of a provision of primary legislation (such as another Act of Parliament) it could not have acted differently. In general, a person who wants to take the UK to the ECtHR must first bring their case before our domestic courts.
Third, UK courts and tribunals must take account of Convention rights in all cases that come before them. This means, for example, that they must develop the common law compatibly with the Convention rights, taking account of Strasbourg case law.
Public authorities and human rights
The guidance for public authorities consists of:
Making sense of human rights - a short introduction: this guide is designed for officials in public authorities to assist them in working with the Human Rights Act 1998. It gives a brief introduction to human rights for use in straightforward situations.

Wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice
The Criminal Cases Review Commission is an independent public body that was set up in March 1997 by the 1995 Criminal Appeal Act. Our purpose is to review possible miscarriages of justice in the criminal courts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and refer appropriate cases to the appeal courts.
The Commission assesses whether convictions or sentences should be referred to a court of appeal
The Commission is based in Birmingham and has about 100 staff, including a core of about 50 caseworkers, supported by administrative staff.
There are nine Commissioners, appointed in accordance with the Office for the Commissioner for Public Appointments’ Code of Practice. They work with the Senior Management Team to ensure the Commission runs efficiently.
We are completely independent and impartial and do not represent the prosecution or the defence.
Our Vision
To enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system, to give hope and bring justice to those wrongly convicted, and based on our experience to contribute to reform and improvements in the law

Medical device adverse incidents
The term 'medical device' covers almost all products, except medicines, that are used in healthcare. They can be used for the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring or treatment of illness or disability.
The range of products is very wide: it includes contact lenses and condoms; heart valves and hospital beds; resuscitators and radiotherapy machines; surgical instruments and syringes; wheelchairs and walking frames.
An adverse incident is an event that caused, or almost caused, an injury to a patient or other person or a wrong or delayed diagnosis and treatment of a patient.
Examples of problems:
faulty brakes on a wheelchair
a faulty ear thermometer giving a low reading
a faulty batch of test strips for a blood glucose meter giving wrong readings.
If your equipment has a fault you should let us know as soon as you can. If possible, keep the faulty equipment until you have contacted us.
For more information go to the adverse incidents page involving medical devices on the MHRA website
Defective medicines (those that are not of an acceptable quality)
Defects in medicines may relate to quality issues with the product itself, the packaging, e.g. carton and blister or other packaging components such as the patient information leaflet. Yellow Card reports of defective medicines are submitted to the defective medicines report centre (DMRC).  The role of the DMRC is to minimise the hazard to patients arising from the distribution of defective medicines by providing an emergency assessment and communication system between manufacturers, distributors, regulatory authorities and users.
Where a defective medicine is considered to present a risk to public health, the company or manufacturer as appropriate, is responsible for recalling any affected batch(es) or, in extreme cases, removing all batches of the product from the market.  DMRC normally supports this action by issuing a drug alert notification to healthcare professionals. Other regulators and countries may be notified of a recall by the issue of a Rapid Alert notification.
If a member of the public has reason to believe that their medicine is not of an acceptable quality they should, in the first instance, consult with their doctor or a pharmacist who may then decide to refer the matter to the MHRA.
Further information about defective medicines can be found on the defective medicines pages on the MHRA website
Counterfeit healthcare products
The MHRA makes sure that the UK has systems in place to prevent counterfeit or fake healthcare products entering the supply chain.  If counterfeit products become available, we make sure we detect counterfeits early and take action to protect the public.
When medicines and medical devices are bought on the internet the source of these products is sometimes difficult to trace and it is highly unlikely that the manufacturers of these products conform to European standards of safety and effectiveness. This means there can be a significant risk of harm to the patient or person using the product.
Yellow Card counterfeit reports are investigated in accordance with the terms of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and Consumer Protection Act 1987, and associated legislation.
The MHRA has statutory powers to enter business and private property to seize products suspected of being in breach of the Human Medicines Regulations. Investigations concerning counterfeits can be complex, involving networks of companies and countries, banks, international law enforcement agencies, solicitors, financial investigators, crime analysts, internet investigators, disclosure officers, test purchasers, and specialists in the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
The MHRA can work with manufacturers to resolve any potential issues and problems. However, where necessary, the MHRA has the powers to take formal enforcement action against individuals and organisations. Offenders can be prosecuted under various regulations and Acts which can result in fines and often imprisonment. Civil injunctions are also given, where appropriate.
Further information about counterfeits can be found on the counterfeit medicines and devices pages on the MHRA website .
Blood factors and immunoglobulin products
Blood factor and immunoglobulin products, such as factors I to XIII or Anti-D (RHO) immunoglobulin, are considered medicines.  Suspected side effects to these products should be reported using the Yellow Card side effect form .

The MHRA is responsible for regulating all medicines and medical devices in the UK by ensuring they work and are acceptably safe.
The MHRA is a centre of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency which also includes the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) , (external link)  and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) . (external link) The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department of Health.
Who we are
Printer friendly version (new window)
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates a wide range of materials from medicines and medical devices to blood and therapeutic products/services that are derived from tissue engineering. This section helps describe how the MHRA manages each of these products, including the use of nanotechnology in some of them
The main difference between how medicines and medical devices are regulated lies in how a product gets onto the market. All medicines are directly approved by the MHRA which issues a 'marketing  authorisation', or licence. Manufacturers and distributors are also licensed directly by MHRA. Medical devices are approved by private sector organisations called 'notified bodies'. Their approval is needed before a CE mark can be put on the device, though the manufacture of low risk devices is simply registered with the MHRA. The MHRA audits the performance of notified bodies. However:
when a product is on the market and in use, there are more similarities than differences in the ways medicines and devices are regulated
there are similar systems for receiving reports of problems with products and similar ways of issuing warnings if problems are confirmed after investigation
there are also similar systems for inspection of manufacture to ensure that companies are complying with regulations, and similar ways of enforcing the law if that proves necessary.
Further information on how we regulate medicines and medical devices is available in our publication:

How we make regulatory decisions about medicines and medical devices
The MHRA and other related organisations make a lot of regulatory decisions. After consulting with a range of stakeholders we have set out on five pages the main considerations that affect those decisions:

No product is ever risk free. Some of the risks are known about when a medicine is first licensed or medical device first used. However, some information only comes to light later as more people use the products. This section includes current and historic alerts, messages and advice and guidance we have issued about products. This section also includes our safety reporting forms for medicines, medical devices and blood.
Safety warnings, alerts and recalls

In the public interest, ministers need the advice they receive on matters relating to the regulation of medicines and medical devices to be impartial. They also need to be able to seek such advice from a wide range of highly skilled professionals who are senior and well regarded in their respective fields and from a range of appointed lay and patient representatives.
A number of independent advisory committees have been established to provide such an advice. These committees can also establish working group to address specific problems. Members of these committees may receive a fee and claim some expenses. This section sets out details about the terms of references of these various committees, their members and the work they undertake.

Welcome to the website of the British Pharmacopoeia.
Since 1864, the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) has been providing authoritative official standards for pharmaceutical substances and medicinal products. It makes an important contribution to the role of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in protecting public health by setting publicly available standards for the quality of medicines.
In addition to expanding the numbers of monographs for licensed formulated products, it supports the regulatory work in the fields of herbal and complementary medicines by providing new monographs for traditional herbal medicinal products and for homoeopathic stocks and mother tinctures. The BP has also begun to improve the control of the quality of unlicensed medicines by providing standards for extensively used unlicensed formulations together with further legal and ethical guidance on the preparation and supply of these products.
The British Pharmacopoeia maintains close ties with the work of the European Pharmacopoeia and continues to play a significant role in the standard-setting process in Europe, participating in the activities of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare, and influencing the decisions of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission through the United Kingdom Delegation. The texts and monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia form an integral part of the BP.
Annually updated, the British Pharmacopoeia is the only comprehensive collection of standards for UK medicinal substances. It is essential for all individuals and organisations involved in pharmaceutical research, development, manufacture, quality control and analysis.
Since its first publication the distribution of the British Pharmacopoeia has grown throughout the world. Now used in approaching 100 countries with exposure in most continents of the world, the BP is setting the standard for pharmaceutical compliance across the globe. Australia and Canada are just two of the countries that have adopted the BP as their national standard alongside the UK.
The current 2014 edition of the BP can be purchased from The Stationery Office (TSO) (external link) and is available in a number of print and electronic formats (The BP 2014 came into effect on the 1st January 2014).

Re-use in copyright terms is the handling of information in a way that was not originally intended. The acts restricted by copyright are: copying, adapting, developing, adding value, broadcasting and commercially exploiting.
If you are not sure whether you need our permission, or have any questions in relation to filling in the form, please contact us for advice.
The application process
We try to process all applications and provide you with a decision within twenty working days of receiving your application. For straightforward applications the process may be quicker. If all reasonable efforts have been made but details of the decision cannot be confirmed within twenty days, you will be informed as soon as possible.
Granting permission to re-use MHRA information
If your request is granted (and a formal licence is not required) you will receive a letter granting permission to reproduce the material in question.
If you are granted permission to reproduce MHRA material and a formal licence is also required, you will receive licence terms and conditions (together with the cost for re-use) for you to accept. Details of licensing terms and conditions together with costs, discounts and waivers are given below.
Once you have accepted the terms and conditions a formal licence will be drawn up and sent to you for signature, together with a fee request for payment.
Exceptions
In principle, all information can be licensed for legitimate re-use by an applicant. However, we may refuse to grant certain applications to re-use Crown copyright material that:
is restricted by legislation, for example the Data Protection Act and Freedom of Information (FOI) Act
is protected by the rights of another organisation and that organisation has not given their permission for re-use
is constrained in practice, by limitations of current technology
may damage the reputation of the Agency; for example, to re-use information in a way that targets vulnerable groups
is intended to be used in a way that could mislead the public
has been superseded or is out of date, unless there is an intention to make it clear that that more up-to-date material is available.
The MHRA may also refuse to grant certain applications seeking to:
produce an exact copy (or a very similar copy) of one of their products or of a product they plan to produce within twelve months of the application;
produce a product that, in their opinion, is likely to affect safety;
use the material for advertising or promotional reasons.
If your application for re-use is refused, full reasons will be given. You will also have the opportunity to appeal against the decision (details of the appeals process can be found below). In all circumstances MHRA will, where possible, offer the applicant an alternative option.
Confidentiality
All information provided in applications to use/re-use information will be treated in confidence. Your personal data will not be made available to others for any purpose.
Licences and terms and conditions
If the MHRA grants permission to use/re-use material, we will issue a licence with terms and conditions, which may involve the payment of a fee.
Licences, and conditions, are based on the template licences and standard terms and conditions for re-use on the OPSI website (external link) and will be prepared and adapted to suit each individual case (example of an MHRA licence). When we licence the use of our material, we treat all our applicants fairly and we will regularly review all of our licences to ensure fairness and transparency. We will send you full details of our terms and conditions, within the offer of a licence agreement, after we have processed your application.
All licensees will also be required to identify the source of the material they are re-using and its copyright status. A sample statement will be provided.
Charging for re-use
For most of the material produced by the Agency, the MHRA, authorises users of publications and visitors to the website, to make one free copy (excluding Agency logos) for the purposes of private research study or reference. For material of a more commercial nature, the MHRA will make a charge for its re-use, recovering the cost of producing and providing the document/information, and including a reasonable return on investment. As a Trading Fund, the MHRA must generate income from the sale and licensing of our services, products and information.
There are two kinds of fees: royalties and fixed fees:
Royalties
A royalty is a fee that is linked to the amount of income generated from the sale of a product. It is generally payable annually.
Our royalty rate is 10% and the formula used for determining royalties due is:
Royalty rate x level of income generated by the product (after taking into account the booksellers’ or agents discount) x percentage of Crown copyright material in the publication, (as judged by the MHRA).
If there is no selling price, or the selling price is below the fair market value for similar products, we will work out royalties based on the same market value. The MHRA retains the right to acquire without charge, a copy of any value-added product openly marketed and sold, in order to supplement its archive.
Fixed fees
Fixed fees would normally be used in the following circumstances:
where the material is re-used in a way that does not involve the offer for sale of a product or service to a customer
where the material represents a small proportion of a large database product.
Fixed fees are payable once or at agreed intervals.
The level of fees charged by the MHRA are as follows:
£500 minimum charge for any information up to 20 pages
£1000 between 21 and 50 pages
£2000 between 51 and 100 pages
£500 for every 100 pages thereafter.
If there is a requirement for regular updates to any information being re-used, then there will be additional charges for this service.
Internet/intranet use
The charging arrangements for the re-use of Crown copyright material originated by the MHRA, on an internet/intranet site, will be subject to separate negotiation, and will depend on intended use.
Bespoke services
Bespoke services will be priced on a project-by-project basis, dependent on the nature of the services and the requirements of the customer. However within any specific UK market sector, the price for identical products and services will be the same.
Discounts and waivers
Exceptional concessions may be granted to organisations or individuals for academic or educational purposes. Where a concession is granted to an organisation or individual, the same concession will be granted to like organisations or individuals in like circumstances.
If we benefit from the re-use of our information, we may consider offsetting any fees against the value of the benefit. For example:
if you provide us with new information that we can use to improve our products;
if your product or service improves safety.
For further details please email copyright@mhra.gsi.gov.uk
Copyright infringement
Under UK law copyright infringement is a criminal offence. Whilst we actively encourage the licensed use of our material, we will protect it against unlicensed use. We constantly monitor the use of our material by other people and organisations. We will pursue any cases where material has been used/re-used without our permission. It is our aim to sort out any problems amicably but we have the right to take any necessary legal action to protect our interests and the interests of our licensed customers.
Complaints
If you are dissatisfied with the response from the Agency to any aspect of our licensing activity you may seek an internal review of that decision. A senior Agency official, who has not previously been involved with your request, will undertake that review. All complaints should be made in writing and sent to:

Accessibility statement
Our commitment
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.

About Prior Informed Consent Procedure (PIC)
In 1999, the United Kingdom  signed the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure (PIC),  which allows signatories to monitor and control the international trade of  certain dangerous chemicals.
In the European Union, Regulation (EU) 649/2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention and is the latest in a series of such regulations on international chemicals trade dating back to 1992.
It promotes shared  responsibility and co-operation and allows countries that are importing certain  hazardous chemicals to specify conditions that the imported chemicals must  meet.
It aims to  protect human health and the environment by providing developing countries with  information on how to store, transport, use and dispose of hazardous chemicals  safely.
This  regulation also includes chemicals from the Stockholm Convention on Persistent  Organic Pollutants (POPS) the export of which is banned.
The Health and Safety Executive  (HSE) and Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland (HSENI) are the Designated National Authorities for the UK. HSE provides information on Regulation (EU) 649/2012 on behalf of the UK Designated National Authorities.

Employers
Employers have new legal duties to automatically enrol certain members of staff into a pension scheme and make contributions towards it. Guidance and tools to help you choose and run a good quality pension scheme.
Closing a scheme
What is automatic enrolment?
UK employers have to automatically enrol their staff into a workplace pension if they meet certain criteria. The law on workplace pensions has now changed and every employer must comply.
Closing a scheme
The essential guide to automatic enrolment
The law on workplace pensions has changed. All employers are legally required to automatically enrol certain staff into a pension scheme and make contributions. You will also have to tell your staff about the scheme you put them in and allow other staff to join if they request to do so.
Prepare for automatic enrolment
Find out how to prepare for automatic enrolment with this step-by-step guide to your new legal duties.
Guidance The essential guide to automatic enrolment
Our electronic brochure outlines the main steps that you need to take to be ready for automatic enrolment. You can also find alternative non-flash and PDF formats below.
Please note: There may be circumstances that are not covered in the guide that could have an impact on the decisions or changes you're required to make. You may need to seek additional guidance or professional advice to ensure that you meet your legal obligations.

Does automatic enrolment apply to me?
Are you an employer with staff working for you in the UK? If so, then yes, automatic enrolment does apply to you and there are things you will need to do.
Subscribe to news-by-email
Subscribe to our news-by-email service – it's a free and easy way to keep up to date with all our developments. You can choose to receive updates on everything or only updates on automatic enrolment.
On this page
Automatic enrolment affects all employers with staff in the UK.
You must enrol certain staff into a pension scheme.
You must start doing this from your staging date, though there is an option to postpone automatic enrolment for up to three months.
You must write to all your staff to tell them how they’ve been affected.
What is automatic enrolment and why do I have to do it?
People are living longer yet too many people are under-saving or not saving at all for what could be a long retirement. The law on workplace pensions has changed to make it easier for millions more people to build up a pension, particularly those on lower incomes.
Automatic enrolment means that, rather than having to actively choose to join a pension scheme, staff are put into one by their employer as a matter of course. If they don’t want to be in the pension scheme, they must actively choose to opt out. It’s to encourage people to stay in pension saving.
Back to top
When will I have to do it?
Automatic enrolment duties come into force for you from your ‘staging date’. You can find out your staging date by entering your PAYE reference into our tool. It also appears on any letters we send you about your duties.
For more information go to what is my staging date? .
You will have the option to postpone automatic enrolment for up to three months from your staging date. If you decide to do this, you won’t need to enrol anyone until the end of the postponement period.
For more information go to postponement .
Who do I need to put into a pension scheme?
You must automatically enrol all staff who are:
aged 22 to state pension age
working in the UK
earning over £10,000 a year.
Some staff who don’t meet the criteria above are able to opt in to the pension scheme you’re using for automatic enrolment. You must put them in if they ask.
You’ll have to pay a minimum employer contribution for all staff you put into this scheme.
Certain other staff can ask to join a pension scheme. You must put these staff in a scheme, but the rules are different and there’s no requirement for you to pay an employer contribution.
It’s the age and earnings of a member of staff that determines what ‘type’ of worker they are and therefore what duties you’ll have for them.
Back to top
What else do I need to do?
You’ll need to write to each member of staff individually to tell them how they’ve personally been affected by automatic enrolment.
The information you’ll need to tell them is different depending on their rights and the duties you have for them.
You must also provide certain information to the regulator about how you’ve complied with your duties.
Back to top
Where do I start?
The first thing you should do is find out your staging date. Once you know when this is, you can start planning to make sure you’re ready in time.
Start planning early
You’ll need to make some changes to allow for automatic enrolment, such as:
setting up a pension scheme or modifying an existing one
making any necessary changes to payroll so it can handle the new requirements
putting systems in place to monitor the ages and earnings of your staff (your payroll may be able to do this)
writing to your staff.
Our automatic enrolment planner will help you find out what you’ll need to do, when you’ll need to do it and roughly how long each part will take.
Closing a scheme
What happens if I don't comply?
There are certain employer duties you must comply with. If you fail to comply with your duties, we may take enforcement action and issue a notice and / or a penalty.
Received a penalty notice? You can now pay your notice online
You can pay your penalty using our secure online payment service. Please have your penalty notice reference handy (shown on the front of your notice).
On this page
Key points
The responsibility for complying with the employer duties rests with the employer.
If you don’t comply, you’ll face enforcement action in line with our risk-based approach.
Enforcement action starts with statutory notices and is followed by penalty notices. Further non compliance may result in court action.
If you have received a penalty notice, you can now pay your notice online.
Our overall approach
We recognise that most employers will want to do the right thing for their staff. Our overall approach is to educate and enable you to comply with the legislation. This puts you in a position to make the right choices and decisions. However, the responsibility for complying will rest with you, the employer.
We will promote good compliance behaviour among employers by ensuring that the legislation is being applied fairly.
In cases where you haven’t understood your duties or have been unable to comply, we’ll work with you to get you compliant.
But if you have chosen to ignore your duties, we will use our powers where necessary to ensure compliance.
Those who do not comply will face enforcement action in line with our risk-based approach.
Back to top
How we will enforce
We will investigate breaches of the law in a fair and objective manner. We can issue formal notices requesting information and can carry out inspections.
We will effectively enforce against non-compliance and have a range of civil and criminal enforcement measures at our disposal.
We shall carry out our work within the better regulation principles to ensure we regulate in a way that is proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted.
Back to top
Our enforcement options
Our full range of enforcement options is summarised below and also explained in the quick guide to our compliance and enforcement strategy at the end of this page.
Informal action
We can issue guidance and instruction by telephone, email, letter and in person. Or we can send a warning letter confirming a set time frame for compliance with the duties.
Statutory notices
Statutory notices can direct you to comply with your duties and / or pay any contributions you have missed or are late in paying. We have further discretionary powers which allow us to estimate and charge interest on unpaid contributions and direct you to calculate and / or pay unpaid contributions.
Penalty notices
We can issue penalty notices to punish persistent and deliberate non-compliance.
A fixed penalty notice will be issued if you don’t comply with statutory notices, or if there’s sufficient evidence of a breach of the law. This is fixed at £400 and payable within a specific period.
We can also issue an escalating penalty notice for failure to comply with a statutory notice. This penalty has a prescribed daily rate of £50 to £10,000 depending on the number of staff you have.
We can issue a civil penalty for cases where you fail to pay contributions due. This is a financial penalty of up to £5,000 for individuals and up to £50,000 for organisations.
Where employers fail to comply with a compliance notice or there is evidence of a breach, we can issue a prohibited recruitment conduct penalty notice. This penalty has a prescribed rate of £1,000 to £5,000 depending on the number of staff the employer has. We aim to fully recover all the penalties that we issue.
What to do if you've received a penalty notice
If you have received a penalty notice, you can pay your penalty using our secure online payment service. Please have your penalty notice reference handy (shown on the front of your notice).
Penalties are in respect of the failure to comply with a compliance notice or unpaid contributions notice.
Please ensure your payment is received by the date shown on the front of your penalty notice. Failure to pay the penalty will result in The Pensions Regulator bringing formal legal proceedings to recover the penalty. Failure to fulfil your employer duties may result in criminal prosecution.
You can also subscribe to receive email alerts and RSS feeds .
For more information on current government consultations go to Directgov .
Setting up a pension scheme
If you don’t have a pension scheme, or don’t want to use an existing scheme, you’ll need to find a provider that can offer an automatic enrolment scheme. Make sure the scheme meets legal requirements and is good quality.
Closing a scheme
Create your action plan for automatic enrolment
This planner has been designed to help you identify what you'll need to do to prepare for automatic enrolment.
Any employer preparing for automatic enrolment should find it helpful, but it’s of particular relevance to you if:
you employ up to 249 staff
every member of staff is based in the UK
you have one Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme
you have or are planning to set up a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme.
Create your action plan
Allow plenty of time to prepare for automatic enrolment. We recommend starting 12 months before your staging date, though this will vary depending on your individual circumstances – not all employers will need to allow so much time.
Step 1
Find out your staging date
To create your action plan, you'll need your staging date. You can find it by entering your PAYE reference into our staging date tool. Even if you think you know it already, it's a good idea to double-check it prior to creating your plan.
Closing a scheme
Raising awareness about automatic enrolment
Your workers are likely to have heard about automatic enrolment through the media and will probably want to know how the changes will affect them.
So it’s a good idea to be prepared for any questions they might have. We have a range of materials to help you communicate the changes to your staff.
On this page
Frequently asked questions
Key points
There's more you can do to help your workers understand automatic enrolment into a workplace pension than simply providing them with the written communication required by law.
As the employer, you're an important and effective channel of communication for your staff throughout the automatic enrolment process. The information you present to them can have a real impact.
A range of key messages across a number of channels works best - keep them short and simple.
Key messages to communicate to your staff
The message about employer and government contributions gains attention, as do facts and figures. Read the Department for Work and Pension's key messages .
Messages around why saving for retirement is important can help engage staff with the subject of workplace pensions.
Staff appreciate an explanation of what automatic enrolment means for them. For example, information about how much they'll contribute and when.
Details of where staff can find out more, either in your organisation or in the workplace and personal pensions information on GOV.UK are helpful.
There are a number of ways you can communicate these messages. A few examples are below.
Back to top
Online articles
Intranet or newsletter articles can be used at various times. Use any or all of the text in the examples, keep them short, and explain where to find out more. Read news in brief (RTF, 11.5kb, 1 page) for suggestions on what to put on your intranet or in a newsletter. You can find more comprehensive content in the intranet article (RTF, 204kb, 2 pages) or newsletter article (RTF, 29.2kb, 2 pages) .
Back to top
Text or email
Text messages or emails are quick ways of letting staff know when automatic enrolment is happening in your organisation. Read the suggestions for text and email alerts (RTF, 38kb, 1 page) . If you use email, there is a risk that the server may file it into the ‘junk email’ folder, so we don’t recommend you rely solely on email as a method of communication.
Back to top
Posters
Posters help raise awareness of automatic enrolment - download the poster template (Word, 1.87mb, 1 page) , which allows you to include your own information too.
Frequently asked questions
Frequently asked questions can answer initial queries from your staff about automatic enrolment into a workplace pension:
Your staging date is when your automatic enrolment duties first come into force.
Your staging date is based on the total number of people in your PAYE scheme.
You can find out your staging date using your PAYE reference.
You can bring your staging date forward but you can’t make it later (unless you are a particular type of small employer - see exceptions ).
What is a 'staging date'?
Every employer will have a date from when the automatic enrolment duties come into force for their business. This is called an employer’s ‘staging date’. Automatic enrolment is being staged in over a period of six years, which started with the largest employers in 2012.
Staging dates are based on the size of an employer’s PAYE scheme on 1 April 2012 – the more people in the PAYE scheme at that time, the earlier the staging date. If you use more than one PAYE scheme, your staging date is based on the total number of people in the largest one that you use.
Staging dates were determined based on the latest PAYE scheme information from HMRC held by us at 1 April 2012.
If you made any changes to your PAYE scheme before this date, they may not be reflected in the data from HMRC.
Back to top
How do I find out my staging date?
You can find out your staging date by entering your PAYE reference into our staging date tool. If you use more than one PAYE scheme, you’ll need to enter the reference for each one you use. Your staging date will be the one that’s earliest.
It’s important that you have the right PAYE reference and enter it correctly so you get the right staging date.
You can find your PAYE reference on a P6 / P9 coding notice. It can also be found on your white payslip booklet, P30BC.
If you’ve had any letters from us about your automatic enrolment duties, your staging date is also printed on these letters.
There are some circumstances where the tool won’t be able to give you the right staging date, for example if you set up in business after 1 April 2012. Read more about the exceptions to using the tool .
Back to top
Can I change my staging date?
Yes – you can bring forward your staging date, but you must notify us. For more information go to bringing your staging date forward .
Certain, small employers can choose to move their staging date back to a later date than the one determined at 1 April 2012 if, on that date, they:
employed fewer than 50 staff, and
had, or were part of, a PAYE scheme that has more than 50 people in it.
If this applies to you go to modified staging dates for some small employers .
If this doesn’t apply to you, you cannot make your staging date later.
Closing a scheme
What will automatic enrolment cost me?
You will need to contribute to the pensions of any staff who are eligible for automatic enrolment. In addition, there’ll be costs associated with setting up and running the pension scheme.
There may be other costs. This page highlights areas where you may incur a cost. However, the cost of implementing and maintaining automatic enrolment will vary widely between employers. Some may be able to absorb all the additional activity in-house, while others will turn to external suppliers or seek external advice.
On this page
Several areas of your business will be impacted by automatic enrolment.
The main cost will be time - some areas require detailed preparations.
You may have to buy or enhance software to manage the day-to-day activities of automatic enrolment, eg payroll.
Preparations will impact upon your staff’s time and you might decide to bring in additional help.
Costs associated with the pension scheme
Compulsory employer contributions are the main costs associated with the pension scheme. You’ll have to pay a minimum employer contribution for everyone you automatically enrol and anyone who opts in.
The minimum amount is being phased in, starting at 1% and rising to 3% of staff’s qualifying earnings - for more information go to contributions and funding .
Use our calculator below to work out your minimum employer contribution for a member of staff. Other costs will vary depending on your provider and the scheme you choose.
Back to top
Getting the right business software
You’ll need software in place that can handle the requirements of automatic enrolment. This will usually be your payroll system. Sometimes, pension providers may offer this service instead.
Speak to your payroll provider about what they can offer. You may have to pay for any upgrades to your existing software. If an upgrade isn’t available, you’ll need to decide whether to get new software that’s been designed to handle automatic enrolment. Or see if you can get additional software and integrate it into your existing payroll system - there may be a cost for this.
For more information go to business software .
Back to top
Additional work for existing suppliers
You are able to delegate many of the automatic enrolment duties to a third party, such as your accountant or a financial adviser, if you wish. If you do this, they may charge extra for their time and services.
Back to top
Time
You may be able to absorb all of the preparations in-house, in which case the main cost to your business will be time. We can’t tell you how much extra time you’ll need as this will vary a lot between employers. But you need to be aware that time will be a significant cost.
Once automatic enrolment is up and running, there’ll be a little extra time required each month to manage the ongoing automatic enrolment responsibilities .
Back to top
Independent financial advice
Seeking financial advice is optional, but if you decide to speak to a financial adviser, there will usually be a fee. The main area in which you may want to seek financial advice is finding a pension scheme that’s most suited to your business.

Changes in age and earnings
You’ll need to monitor any changes in age and earnings of your staff. Your business software eg your payroll, will need to be able to alert you to any new or existing staff becoming eligible for automatic enrolment.
Other circumstances
The law applies to people who work in the UK. If you have staff working outside the UK, read the section on ‘Working in the UK’ in Assessing the workforce detailed guidance (which you can find at the bottom of this page) for more information.
If you have contractors or agency staff working for you, you’ll need to carry out other checks to see whether you have employer duties for them. See section 2 of our detailed guidance employer duties and defining the workforce, which you can find at the bottom of this page.
Back to top
When to assess
We recommend you make a quick assessment of your workforce several months before your staging date. This is so you get an idea of who you'll have to enrol. You’ll need to make sure the data you hold about your staff, such as their full names, dates of birth, contact details and National Insurance numbers are all up to date.
If you don't have a pension scheme already, you’ll have to find one. To find out how to choose a scheme and find a provider go to setting up a pension scheme .
You'll have to do a formal assessment on your staging date (or after postponement) so you know exactly who you’ll have to automatically enrol. For more information go to On and after your staging date .
Automatic enrolment declaration of compliance (registration)
Automatic enrolment declaration of compliance (registration) is a secure, online service accessed through the Government Gateway.
Find out what information you must provide to The Pensions Regulator and when you have to do it. If you have a query about completing your declaration see our automatic enrolment declaration questions .
We’ve produced various resources to help you complete your declaration which can be found in related content .
Why do I need to complete a declaration of compliance (registration)?
Completing a declaration is the legal requirement to submit information to the regulator about how you’ve complied with your employer duties. If you don’t do it in time, you could be fined.
On this page
When do I have to do it?
Key points
You must provide certain information to the regulator about how you’ve complied with the automatic enrolment duties, such as how many people you’ve automatically enrolled and into which pension scheme(s).
You must complete your declaration of compliance even if you don’t have anyone to automatically enrol.
Declaration is mandatory and you could get fined if you don’t do it in time.
Your declaration deadline is five calendar months after your staging date.
Declaration provides a snapshot of your workforce on your staging date and you’ll need to account for each person.
You can complete your declaration by answering questions and providing details online . You should start filling in your details as soon as you can.
What information do I need to provide?
You’ll need your letter code and PAYE reference to access the declaration of compliance online service:
Letter codes
The letter code is a 10-digit reference beginning with a ‘1’ that’s unique to every employer.
It can be found on all written correspondence from us. If you don’t know yours or have never received it, please contact customersupport@autoenrol.tpr.gov.uk providing the following:
employer name
your contact details (telephone number, email address, job role).
PAYE references
Your PAYE reference is on a P6 / P9 coding notice. It can also be found on your white payslip booklet, P30BC.
You’ll need to tell us things like how many people were in employment on your staging date , how many of those you’ve automatically enrolled and how many people were already in a pension scheme with you. You’ll need to account for everyone who worked for you on your staging date so make sure you provide exact numbers.
We’ll also need details about the pension scheme (or schemes) you’re using for automatic enrolment, particularly the employer pension scheme reference (EPSR) or pension scheme registry number (PSR number). If you don’t have this reference on your scheme paperwork, make sure you contact the trustees or managers of the scheme to get this in good time.

Declaration of compliance (registration) checklist
You can use our declaration checklist to help you gather all the information you need to provide us with for your automatic enrolment declaration.
Back to top
When do I have to do it?
The deadline for completing your declaration of compliance is five calendar months from your staging date. For example, if your staging date is 1 November 2014, you must submit your declaration to us no later than 31 March 2015.
If your declaration deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, you can provide your declaration on the next working day.
You should make a start filling in details before your staging date. Filling in details as you go through your planning process will help you avoid missing your deadline.
Because the purpose of the declaration is to tell us about every person who was in employment on your staging date, you won’t be able to complete it or submit it to us until after your staging date.
If you’ve postponed automatic enrolment for any of your staff, you mustn’t submit your declaration until after the postponement period has ended. This could mean there’s very little time between the end of the postponement period and your declaration deadline, which is why it’s a good idea to fill in details as you get them. You can complete everything in advance except for the information about your workforce.
Don’t leave it until the last day to start – you’re likely to run out of time and won’t be fully compliant.
Why do I need to complete a declaration of compliance (registration)?
Closing a scheme
Does your existing scheme qualify?
If you want to continue using your existing pension scheme you need to check that it meets the qualifying criteria.
If it does qualify, you can carry on using it as normal for existing scheme members. If you want to use it to automatically enrol new members, it will need to meet some additional criteria.
If you don’t have an existing pension scheme that you can use, you’ll need to choose a new one. Go to finding a provider.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Use our tool to assess whether your existing defined contribution (DC) scheme qualifies and if you can use it for automatic enrolment.
If you have a defined benefit (DB) or hybrid scheme, speak to the scheme trustees.
DC qualifying scheme tool
You need to check whether your existing DC scheme qualifies and if you can use it for automatic enrolment. Our DC qualifying schemes tool will guide you through the areas you need to look at to make an informed decision.
Because every scheme is different, the tool is unable to tell you whether your particular scheme meets the criteria. You will need to work out whether you can use your scheme.
If you don’t feel confident about deciding whether your scheme meets the criteria, you should ask the trustees or scheme provider running it.

DB and hybrid schemes
Qualifying criteria for DB and hybrid schemes are complex. Speak to your trustees to check whether your scheme qualifies.
Closing a scheme
Setting up a pension scheme
If you don’t have a pension scheme, or don’t want to use an existing scheme, you’ll need to find a provider that can offer an automatic enrolment scheme. Make sure the scheme meets legal requirements and is good quality.
When you’ve chosen a provider, you’ll need to work with them to get your scheme up and running.

Information to put into your software
Key points
You’ll need to know which of your staff you have to automatically enrol and which will have a right to request to join, and you’ll need software to help you do this.
The software will need to monitor the ages and earnings of your staff and tell you what you need to do with each member of staff.
You should test that your software works before your staging date.
You’ll need to do a data cleansing exercise to make sure your records are up to date.
Automatic enrolment functionality
The functionality needed to help you assess whether your staff should be automatically enrolled may already be built into the payroll software you use. Or the person who does your payroll for you may already have appropriate software.
You should check with your software or payroll provider to see if your current systems will work out who you have to automatically enrol.
Back to top
Questions to ask software providers
You need to find out if your software can identify whether you have staff that you will need to automatically enrol. If you don’t have access to the necessary software, you will need to get it. When speaking to your existing software provider or selecting new software, you should ask whether the system:
assesses your workforce
allows the use of postponement
calculates pension contributions
handles opt outs and refunds
supports you in generating and issuing letters to your staff
keeps records and provide reports
interoperates with some or all pension scheme provider systems.
If you are selecting new software you should ensure that it is compatible with your existing systems.
Back to top
Information to put into your software
Having got the right software in place, you’ll need to know how to use it before you get to your staging date. This means understanding:
what information you need to put in
how to configure it
what outputs the software will give and how.
You’ll need to test your software ahead of your staging date to ensure you understand how it works. And to check that you know where to find all the information you’ll need.
Maintaining up-to-date records
It is crucial that you hold accurate information about your staff, their personal and address information and the contributions that have been made on their behalf.
Inaccurate records or missing data can have serious consequences, which can include staff being automatically enrolled at the wrong time, information about automatic enrolment not getting to the staff member, and the wrong amount being paid to your staff at retirement. It is your responsibility to ensure that records are correct and up-to-date.

Implementing automatic enrolment
Find out what you need to do to automatically enrol your staff into a good quality pension scheme.
Check your progress
If you're nearing your staging date, the resources below summarise the preparations you need to have in place.
Postponement
You can choose to postpone automatic enrolment for up to three months for some or all of your staff. You must write to your staff to tell them you’re postponing automatic enrolment for them. One of the times you can postpone is from your staging date.
On and after your staging date
On your staging date, the automatic enrolment duties for your business come into force.
From your staging date, you’ll have to automatically enrol all staff who are eligible. You’ll also have to write to each member of staff to tell them what automatic enrolment means for them.
When you must do this depends on whether you’ve decided to postpone. You’ll then need to a complete a declaration of compliance (registration) with us to tell us how you’ve complied.
On this page
Key points
Your staging date is when the automatic enrolment duties come into force for your business.
You’ll need to identify what your duties are for each member of staff on your staging date or at the end of postponement. You’ll need to have the correct software in place to help you correctly identify your duties.
If you’re postponing automatic enrolment, the postponement period starts from your staging date.
You’ll have six weeks from your staging date or the day after postponement ends to enrol all staff who are eligible and make them active members of your pension scheme.
You’ll have six weeks from your staging date during which you must write to all staff telling them about their rights and what automatic enrolment means for them, or that you’ve postponed automatic enrolment for them.
You’ll have five months from your staging date to complete your declaration and submit it to us, to tell us how you’ve complied.
Postponing automatic enrolment at staging
You can use postponement on your staging date to delay automatic enrolment for some or all staff for up to three months. For example, if you know someone will be leaving within three months of your staging date, you can apply postponement to them. This means you won’t need to assess them to identify what duties you have for them until the last day of the postponement period, at which point you must automatically enrol any who are eligible.
For more information go to postponement .
Back to top
Identifying your duties
You’ll need to know which staff you’ll have to automatically enrol and which staff have a right to opt in or join your pension scheme. You must make this assessment on either:
your staging date, or
the last day of the postponement period.
To remind yourself of what to assess go to know your workforce .
Your duties
At staging or when postponement ends, your key duties are to:
automatically enrol all staff who are eligible and make them active members of your pension scheme
write to each member of staff to tell them how automatic enrolment affects them
submit a declaration online to us to tell us how you’ve complied with your duties.
You’ll need to tell your pension scheme about the staff you’re enrolling. To find out what you need to arrange with your pension scheme go to setting up a pension scheme .
For information about how to make someone a member of your pension scheme go to automatically enrolling your staff .
For more information about telling us you’ve complied and why this is important go to using automatic enrolment online declaration .
You can only postpone automatic enrolment from:
your staging date
a staff member’s first day of employment
the date a staff member first becomes eligible for automatic enrolment.
If you postpone from your staging date, it doesn’t change your staging date.
Back to top
Postponing automatic enrolment
You must write to tell the staff whose automatic enrolment you’re postponing. You will have six weeks from the date postponement starts to write to them. There’s no need to tell us that you’ve decided to postpone automatic enrolment.
You can postpone for up to three months. You can postpone as many or as few staff as you like and the postponement period doesn’t have to be the same length for everyone.
Our employer letter template tool helps you write to staff as required by law. There are four letters you can use for postponement for different circumstances. If you’re postponing from staging, we recommend you use letter template 6, below. You can tailor the letter templates to your needs.
Back to top
During the postponement period
Staff whose automatic enrolment you’ve postponed can choose to opt in to your pension scheme during the postponement period.
For more information about what to do if you get an opt-in request go to opting in and joining .
Back to top
At the end of the postponement period
On the last day of the postponement period, you’ll need to know whether any member of staff whose automatic enrolment you’ve postponed is still eligible to be automatically enrolled. If they are, you must put them into a pension scheme straight away. You cannot apply a further period of postponement even if you postponed for less than the three months allowed.
Back to top
Staff already in a qualifying pension scheme
If you already have a qualifying pension scheme, you’ll still need to write to those staff who are in the scheme. This is to tell them about automatic enrolment and that they won’t be affected as they are already in your pension scheme.
To write to staff who are eligible for automatic enrolment but who are already in your existing pension scheme use letter template 4 and its guidance below.
Guidance for Letter template 4 (DOC, 33kb, 2 pages)
The time limits for writing to your staff
You must write to your staff within six weeks of your staging date. After staging, when automatic enrolment is business as usual, you must write within six weeks of the day a new staff member joins or becomes eligible to be automatically enrolled. The exception is for existing scheme members who must be contacted within two months.
Sending the letters
The information you send must be in writing, so you can send the letters by post or email. The letters must be sent individually. You can ask a third party, like your accountant or financial adviser to send the letters on your behalf, but it remains your responsibility to make sure the right information gets to the right member of staff at the right time.
Closing a scheme
Automatically enrolling your staff
You’ll need to automatically enrol your staff into the pension scheme you’ve chosen. The process you must follow is set out in law.
You must provide the pension scheme with certain information about your staff. You’ll also need to write to your staff to tell them they’ve been automatically enrolled. You must do all this within certain time frames.
On this page
Detailed guidance
Key points
You automatically enrol staff by giving the pension scheme information about them so the scheme can make them active members.
The scheme must make staff active members within six weeks of them first becoming eligible for automatic enrolment.
Contributions are due from the date the staff member first becomes eligible.
You must write to staff to tell them you’ve automatically enrolled them.
When to automatically enrol
You must make eligible staff active members of your pension scheme within a six week period that starts on the date your staff member first becomes eligible for automatic enrolment. This could be:
your staging date
the day after their postponement period ends
their first day of employment
their 22nd birthday
when they start earning over £10,000.
Your business software should be set up to alert you if someone becomes eligible for automatic enrolment.
If someone with a right to opt in to your pension scheme asks to do so, you must enrol them following the same process as for automatic enrolment.
Back to top
How to automatically enrol
You make eligible staff members of your pension scheme by providing the scheme (or trustee) with all the information they need to make your staff active members. You’ll need to provide this information before the end of the six week period described above.
Some information that you’ll need to provide is required by law. This includes things like the staff member’s name, postal address, date of birth and National Insurance number.
You’ll need to provide this information in writing, which can include email.
Back to top
When scheme membership must start
After you’ve given the information to your pension scheme about the member of staff you’re automatically enrolling, the scheme will take a few days to make them an active member. Active scheme membership must take effect from the date they first became eligible for automatic enrolment, as described in ‘when to automatically enrol’, above.
This means that contributions will be due and you must calculate them from that date.
Back to top
Writing to the staff you're automatically enrolling
Before the end of the six week period after staff first become eligible for automatic enrolment, you must write to everyone you’ve automatically enrolled about the scheme, the contribution rates and about their right to opt out.
Key points
Staff who have been automatically enrolled or who have opted in have the right to opt out.
The decision to opt out must be taken freely by your staff member.
Staff cannot opt out until after they’ve been automatically enrolled.
The opt-out period is one month from when active membership is created, or they receive your letter with the enrolment information, whichever is latest.
Staff opt out by getting an opt-out notice from the pension scheme which they then complete and give to you.
You must issue a full refund of any contributions the staff member has made within a month of receiving a valid notice.
The opt-out period
Once staff have been enrolled into the pension scheme, they have one calendar month during which they can opt out and get a full refund of any contributions. This is known as the ‘opt-out period’. It starts from the whichever date is the later of:
the date active membership was achieved, or
the date they received your letter with the enrolment information.
Staff can’t opt out before the opt-out period starts or after it ends. If they decide to leave the scheme outside this period, they will instead be ‘ceasing active membership’. Whether they get a refund of contributions will depend on the pension scheme rules.
Back to top
When someone opts out
Staff opt out by giving you an ‘opt-out notice’. The opt-out notice is provided by the pension scheme. This is to avoid any employer involvement in the decision to opt out, which could lead to a breach of the law. With some pension schemes, you can arrange for the staff member to be able to complete the opt-out notice online.
If you get an opt-out notice, check it’s valid. That means it contains all of the information listed in statutory information to be included in the opt-out notice, below. If any of the information listed is missing, you must tell the staff member who will have to resubmit the notice. The opt-out period is extended to six weeks if you get an invalid notice, to allow the staff member enough time to correct it.
When you set up your pension scheme, you will have agreed with them how they handle opt outs. You must do whatever they need you to do to process the opt-out request.
When a staff member opts out, you must stop payroll from deducting any further contributions straight away.
Back to top
Refunds
You must give the staff member a full refund of any contributions they’ve made. Your payroll will have a record of how much this is. You’ll need to refund any contributions they’ve made within a month of them opting out. Normally, you should issue the refund in the next payroll after you get the opt-out notice.
The pension scheme will refund to you any contributions it’s received for that staff member.
Don’t wait for the scheme to refund you before you refund your staff member as this could mean you miss the one-month deadline.
Using automatic enrolment online declaration of compliance (registration)
Automatic enrolment declaration of compliance (registration) is a secure, online service accessed through the Government Gateway.
Find out who can complete the declaration and what to do if you’re acting on behalf of an employer. If you have a query about completing the declaration see our automatic enrolment declaration of compliance questions .
Start your declaration of compliance today
Start your declaration now
We recommend starting your declaration as soon as you can. Adding the required information as it becomes available will help make sure you don't miss your deadline. Your declaration will be complete once you complete and submit all the required information to us.
On this page
Key points
You must tell us how you’ve complied with your automatic enrolment duties by providing certain information.
Automatic enrolment declaration is an online process.
You will need a Government Gateway User ID, your letter code and your PAYE reference to submit your declaration.
Employers and third parties, such as accountants or advisers, can complete the declaration on the employer’s behalf.
It’s possible to complete declaration for multiple employers using one login by selecting the ‘acting on behalf of an employer’ option.
Start filling in details early on to help make sure you don’t miss the deadline.
Government Gateway
Government Gateway allows you to communicate and make transactions across various government sites from a single, secure point of entry. You’ll need a Government Gateway User ID before you can use the online automatic enrolment declaration service.
When you first sign up to use the service, you’ll be asked if you already have a Government Gateway User ID. If you do, for example, for submitting tax returns to HM Revenue and Customs, you can use the same one. If you don’t, you’ll be able to create one as part of the sign-up process.
For more information go to Government Gateway .
Back to top
Who can complete the declaration?
It’s the employer’s duty to complete the automatic enrolment declaration of compliance. But employers can authorise someone else to act on their behalf, if they prefer. For example, you may want to ask your accountant who already deals with your PAYE returns for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). If you use a third party, it’s still your responsibility to make sure all the information provided on your behalf is true and correct.
When you first access the automatic enrolment declaration online service, you’ll need to select whether you’re declaring as the employer or if you’re acting on behalf of an employer:
‘Employer’ here means anyone working within the employer organisation who is completing a declaration for only one employer.
If you’re completing a declaration for more than one employer within your corporate group, select ‘acting on behalf of an employer’.
If you don’t work within the employing organisation, for example, accountants or IFAs, select ‘acting on behalf of an employer’.
You’ll need the employer’s letter code and PAYE reference to log in and start the declaration.
Back to top
Employers completing the declaration
If you have an existing Government Gateway User ID, use it to log into our automatic enrolment declaration of compliance online service.
If you don’t have a Government Gateway User ID, select ‘no’ when asked. This will take you to a screen where you can create one straight away. You’ll need it each time you log in to the declaration online service.
Back to top
Declaration if you're acting on behalf of an employer
Your clients may ask you to complete the declaration of compliance for them. You can act on behalf of multiple clients using one login.
Anyone completing declarations for several employers within their corporate group can do it all on one login. This saves you having to log in multiple times and generate several different user IDs.
When you first sign up to use the automatic enrolment declaration online service on behalf of an employer, you’ll need to get your unique employer agent reference number from us. We’ll ask you to fill in a short form with your name and contact details, then we’ll email your employer agent reference number to you straight away.
You’ll also need a Government Gateway User ID. If you already have one, you can use that. If not, you can create one when you log in to use the service.
When you’ve got both your employer agent reference number and your Government Gateway User ID, you can start filling in details straight away.
Filling in information as you get it
We recommend starting your automatic enrolment declaration of compliance before your staging date.
You can add details that you already know, like the employer address and your own contact details. Add information as it becomes available, such as details about the pension scheme you’ll use for automatic enrolment once you’ve set it up.
This will make it easier when it comes to submitting your declaration, particularly if you postpone automatic enrolment and only have a short amount of time between the end of the postponement period and your declaration deadline.
If your declaration deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, you can provide your declaration on the next working day.
Opting in and joining are not the same.
Staff opt in or join by writing to you.
The pension scheme you use for staff who opt in must be suitable for automatic enrolment.
You don’t have to pay an employer contribution into the pensions of staff who join.
How staff opt in or join
As part of your employer duties, you’ll have written to the staff who weren’t eligible for automatic enrolment telling them about their right to opt into, or join, a pension scheme.
Staff can decide to opt in or join at any point. They do this by writing to you.
Back to top
When you receive an opt in or joining request
All requests to opt in or join must be in writing and signed by the person asking to opt in or join. If they sent it to you electronically, it must include a statement from them that they personally submitted the request.
It could be months or even years after you first told staff about their right to opt in or join that they choose to do so. So you’ll need to check they’re still entitled to opt in or join by checking their age and earnings. Your business software (eg payroll) will help you.
Checking the right to opt in
Staff who can opt in are:
aged 16-21, or state pension age to 74
earning above £10,000 a year
or
aged 16-74
earning above £5,772 up to and including £10,000 a year.
Staff who have previously opted out, either from being automatically enrolled or from opting in, can also opt in again. But if they’ve already asked to opt in in the last 12 months and subsequently opted out or ceased membership, it’s up to you to decide whether to enrol them. There’s no obligation to do so.
Checking the right to join
Staff who can join are:
aged 16 to 74
Back to top
What you must do
If the requests are signed and the staff member still has the right to opt in or join, you must enrol them into a pension scheme.
If the request isn’t signed, the staff member will need to resubmit it signed.
Staff opting in
You must enrol staff who have opted into a pension scheme you are using for automatic enrolment. You must usually do this within a month of receiving their request. Once in the pension scheme, they are treated the same as staff you’ve automatically enrolled which means you must pay an employer contribution.
Staff joining
The pension scheme you put these staff into doesn’t have to be one you use for automatic enrolment and you don’t have to pay an employer contribution unless you want to. But the scheme you put them into should still be good quality. The scheme provider will tell you the date when the staff member will go into the scheme.

Key points
You must keep records about your staff and your pension scheme.
Ensure that you have all your records ready for automatic enrolment and have the right processes in place to manage any changes.
Make sure you provide the right information to your pension schemes.
Which records to keep
By law, there are two different types of records that an employer must keep:
Records about staff
Records about the pension scheme
You must keep these records for a minimum of six years (except for records of opt-outs which you must keep for four years).
You can find a list of the records that must be kept in our detailed guidance on keeping records below.
Back to top
Keeping records
You must retain any opt-in, joining or opt-out notices you receive from your staff as this is proof that they have exercised these rights.
You must keep these records in a legible format so that the regulator can understand them, if we ask to see them. Employers staging on or after 1 January 2014 will have a new declaration of compliance (registration) deadline due to a change in the law.
If you outsource your business or pensions administration to a third party, it’s still your legal responsibility to make sure they follow the same rules as above. The records must be provided to us in a timely manner, if we ask to see them.
Workplace pensions law has changed and every employer must comply. Find out more .

Process any opt-in, joining or opt-out requests.
Keep and maintain accurate records.
Re-enrol every three years.
All of this should become 'business as usual', just like real-time PAYE.
Contributions
You must calculate and pay your own contributions to your pension scheme on behalf of your staff, as well as calculating, deducting and paying over your staff’s own contributions.
You will have agreed contribution rates and when to pay them with your pension scheme when you were setting it up. The amount you must pay must be at or above the minimum amount set in law.
For more information about the minimum rates and paying contributions to your scheme go to contributions and funding .
Back to top
Changes in staff's age and earnings
You’ll need to monitor any changes in age and earnings of your staff so you can identify if they become eligible for automatic enrolment. You must also check eligibility of any new member of staff. Your business software, eg your payroll, should be able to support you with this monitoring.
For more information on how to assess your staff’s age and earnings go to know your workforce .
Back to top
Opt outs
‘Opting out’ is when a staff member decides to leave your pension scheme within a month of being enrolled and get a full refund of any contributions they’ve made.
For more information on the opt-out period and what to do, including issuing refunds, go to opting out .
Back to top
Opt-ins and joiners
Some staff who aren’t eligible for automatic enrolment have a right to ‘opt in’ to your automatic enrolment scheme. Staff who opt in are entitled to an employer contribution from you.
Other staff, who earn under a certain amount, are entitled to ‘join’ a pension scheme. Though there’s no entitlement in law for you to pay an employer contribution for these staff, you can choose to if you wish.
To find out who can opt in and who can join a scheme, and what you must do if they ask to do so, go to opting in and joining .
Back to top
Keeping records
You must keep up-to-date records about your staff, including who you’ve automatically enrolled and when, information about your pension scheme, and the contributions you are paying.
To find out what information you need to keep about your staff and your pension scheme go to record-keeping .
Back to top
Re-enrolment
Every three years, you’ll need to re-enrol those staff who have opted out back into your automatic enrolment pension scheme, provided they’re still eligible. You’ll also need to complete a re-declaration of compliance with us. The process for both is basically the same as at staging or after postponement.
Back to top
Keeping payment information and records
Incorrect or out-of-date information is the main cause of payment failure and disputes between an employer and their scheme provider or trustees.
You must keep information and records about what contributions you pay to your pension scheme for six years (in most cases). This will help you ensure the correct contributions are paid and provide evidence if there’s a dispute.
Records you should keep include:
staff gross earnings
staff and employer pension scheme contributions due to be paid (and if different the actual amounts paid).
You need to keep information on contributions and membership up to date and communicate any changes to your pension scheme provider or trustees.
As part of your normal day-to-day administration arrangements it’s good practice to provide the following ‘payment information’ to your scheme:
any changes to a member’s earnings or contribution entitlement
details of members leaving or joining the scheme.
Your pension scheme provider or trustees need this payment information to meet their duties such as monitoring contributions and reporting material payment failures to the regulator.
You should agree a process for this when you set up the scheme. This may include you giving updated earnings information at the same time as you pay contributions across to the scheme.
Providers or trustees may ask you for additional payment information which you must provide within seven working days. You risk being fined by the regulator if you don’t provide this information on time.
You can find further information on the records you must keep in record-keeping .

Pension fund limits
There are limits to the amount which can be held in a pension fund and the amount that can be contributed to it each year for a member without the imposition of certain tax charges.
Go to understanding the annual allowance for pension schemes on HM Revenue and Customs website .
If you’re unsure what to pay and when, contact your pension scheme provider or trustees.
Back to top
Defined benefit funding
If you run a defined benefit (DB) scheme, you need to be aware that most schemes providing any defined benefits need to meet a statutory funding objective, which assesses the required levels of funding for a scheme.
As an employer, you’ll need to work closely with trustees to ensure that your scheme meets these funding requirements.
In particular, you’ll have to agree with the trustees:
a statement of funding principles
a schedule of contributions consistent with these principles.
Where the statutory funding objective is not met, you have to agree on a recovery plan setting out the steps that will be taken to put things right.
For more information on how to ensure your DB scheme is appropriately funded and that contributions are paid on time go to funding your defined benefit scheme .

Funding your defined benefit scheme
You need to ensure your defined benefit (DB) pension scheme is appropriately funded and that contributions are paid on time.

Key points
DB scheme funding is something in respect of which you need to engage with your scheme's trustees.
Statutory funding objective
If you run a DB pension scheme, you need to be aware that most schemes providing any defined benefits need to meet a statutory funding objective, which assesses the required levels of funding for a scheme.
As an employer, you’ll need to work closely with the trustees to ensure that your scheme meets these funding requirements. In particular, you’ll most likely be required to agree with the trustees:
a statement of funding principles
a schedule of contributions consistent with these principles
a recovery plan setting out the steps that will be taken to address the shortfall where the statutory funding objective is not met.
Your role as an employer is summarised in the code of practice: funding defined benefits . If you have any questions about the code see our scheme funding FAQs .
We appreciate that there are a number of factors (including events in the wider economy) which can have an impact on your ability to fund your pension scheme. We’ve published the following case studies and statements to help you:
Three scheme scenarios which illustrate how we see the approaches set out in our annual funding statement working in practice.
Annual funding statements
Our annual funding statement provides guidance to trustees undertaking valuations. It's relevant to trustees and employers of all DB schemes but is primarily aimed at those who are currently undertaking valuations. An annual funding statement sets out our view in relation to the risks facing schemes with effective valuation dates for that particular year.
You can find current and previous annual funding statements, along with supporting analysis, in our statements section .

Corporate sales and employer departures
Some corporate transactions could affect your ability to meet your obligations to the pension scheme either on an ongoing basis or in the event of insolvency and, as a result, be detrimental to the scheme and its members. For example, the following transactions could have such an effect:
selling or restructuring your business
making a return of capital
exiting a multi-employer pension scheme.
You will need to consider the effects on the pension schemes involved and the legal implications of your actions, including whether the transactions could, potentially, be seen as falling within the remit of the regulator’s anti-avoidance powers.
The effect of some group restructures can be the termination of the participation of certain employers in a pension scheme. Generally, when an employer ceases to participate in a DB multi-employer pension scheme, a debt will become payable to the scheme, equal to the departing employer’s share of the scheme’s buyout deficit, unless the employer enters into an alternative arrangement that reduces its liability. This debt is enforceable by the trustees against the employer.
For more information on corporate transactions and employer departures from multi-employer schemes please see the following guidance:
• There is certain information about your pension scheme which must be shared with the regulator.
• Exchange, our online service, can be used to share the required information with the regulator.
What must be reported
In order to meet your regulatory duties you must share the following information with the regulator:
register your pension scheme
report a breach of the law
report a notifiable event (defined benefit schemes only)
pay the levy
amend or wind up your scheme.
You can share information with us about your pension scheme easily and quickly using our online service Exchange .
Back to top
Registration of a pension scheme
Most occupational and personal pension schemes have to be registered with the regulator. Trustees of occupational pension schemes and managers of personal pension schemes are responsible for the scheme’s registration.
Pension scheme details can be registered or updated online using Exchange .
This information helps us to maintain a complete and accurate register of pension schemes and to hold up-to-date scheme information. It’s used to calculate the levy payable for each scheme and is also used by the Pensions Tracing Service.
Back to top
Scheme return
Registrable schemes must also provide a regular scheme return to the regulator, containing prescribed information. A return is required when the scheme receives a scheme return notice from the regulator. As an employer, you must ensure that trustees (or managers of the scheme) have the information they need to complete the regular scheme return.
A scheme return is how we capture information about pension schemes that we use to help maintain our register of pension schemes. We share this information with the Pension Protection Fund and the Pension Tracing Service .
It's the trustees' or manager’s responsibility to keep the regulator informed of any changes to registrable scheme details. Exchange provides an easy way to do this, which enables scheme details to be updated at any time. By keeping the registrable scheme details updated throughout the year the trustees or manager of the scheme will find it easier to complete the scheme return when required to do so.
For more information go to scheme return .
Back to top
Report a breach of the law
Employers and other individuals involved in running a pension scheme have a legal duty to report a breach of the law where it is likely to be of material significance to the regulator.
Back to top
Report a notifiable event (for DB schemes only)
If you are an employer of a defined benefit (DB) scheme, you and the trustees have to tell us promptly about certain 'notifiable' events.
These are specific events prescribed by the regulations which may have a significant impact on the security of members' benefits.
For more information go to notifiable events .

Report late payment of contributions
We’ve updated our codes of practice on reporting late payment of contributions to defined contribution (DC) occupational and personal pension schemes and accompanying guidance.
The codes and the accompanying guidance aim to improve transparency and ensure that everyone involved in the flow of contributions has a clear understanding of their responsibilities.
Closing a scheme
Comparing costs for DB schemes
It’s important that you understand how much it costs to run your defined benefit (DB) pension scheme. These costs can include fees for administration, advice and services to members.
The amount you pay to run your scheme will vary depending on its design and needs, its complexity and the trustee and sponsoring employer's own skills. So understanding what you are paying and the range of charges for each type of cost is important.
We have produced a tool that shows information about costs in schemes of various sizes. You may find it helpful to compare what you pay to run your own scheme against the typical cost for schemes of a similar size.
You can use our tool to view highlights from our defined benefit (DB) scheme running costs research report 2014 and compare costs information for schemes of a similar size to your own.
See related content in the employers' section
You need to ensure your DB pension scheme is appropriately funded and that contributions are paid on time.

Thinking about retiring
Most defined contribution (DC) pension schemes write to their members up to five years before they expect them to retire. Your staff can check their possible retirement income on the Money Advice Service website and request an estimate of their State Pension on the GOV.UK website .
Back to top
Retirement options and decisions
Your pension scheme should send members information about their options and the decisions they need to make. At this stage, they need to:
decide whether they want to retire now or later
decide whether to take a cash lump sum
choose a suitable retirement income product
decide what to do if they only have a small pension pot
decide what to do if they have more than one pension pot.
There is a code of conduct on retirement choices for consumers in the retirement income market (PDF) which has been developed by the Association of British Insurers. Your product provider or trustees could use this as a guide to sending information to members at the appropriate times.
Different types of retirement income
Your pension scheme members have a choice of options when converting their pension funds into retirement income.
Lifetime annuity
At retirement, many pension scheme members choose to buy a lifetime annuity with their pension pot which provides them with a regular payment for life.
There are different types of annuity to choose from including joint annuities, increasing annuities and annuities based on your health. Usually they can shop around to choose which provider they want to buy it from.
Once someone has taken out an annuity, they can’t change their mind and get their pension pot back, so it’s very important to get this decision right.
The Pensions Advisory Service’s online annuity planner will help them through the decision-making process for choosing a retirement income product.
Other retirement income choices
There are other options available which are only suitable for members with a large pension pot or other sources of income. These include income drawdown, fixed-term annuities, hybrid products and phased retirement.
Your staff should get professional financial advice if they’re considering any of these options.
For more about finding a professional adviser go to the Money Advice Service .

You need to review your scheme either formally or informally.
Think about if the scheme is still relevant to you and your staff.
We have developed quality features to assess the quality of a pension scheme.
Review a DC scheme
The best way to review the quality of an existing defined contribution (DC) pension scheme is to speak to the trustees or scheme provider. You should ask them whether it includes our DC quality features. We have developed the DC quality features as a way for trustees and providers to assess whether their scheme is likely to deliver good retirement outcomes for members.
If you need to select a new scheme and are interested in carrying out a more detailed assessment of quality of schemes offered by providers, see below for our employer’s guide to selecting a good quality pension scheme for automatic enrolment.
You can find pension scheme providers in a number of ways, including by using an adviser. You should ask providers some key questions to help you check their scheme meets the automatic enrolment rules and is good quality. For more information go to finding a provider .
While it’s not a legal requirement, you may want to consider putting in place some monitoring of the scheme to ensure it’s being run well. See our guide below on monitoring your pension scheme.
Back to top
Retirement options
If you have a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme, the trustee (or scheme manager) or pension provider must tell your scheme members they can buy an annuity (which pays them an income for the rest of their life) from the insurance company of their choice and they don’t have to take the one offered by the scheme. This is called the ‘open-market option’ (OMO) and means your staff can make sure they get the best deal.
You may choose to provide your scheme members with additional support to help them make important decisions about their retirement (even though you’re not legally obliged to).
For example, some organisations arrange group presentations to tell scheme members about their retirement options. This could be run by an adviser, the pension provider, trustees, or an in-house human resources (HR) or pensions manager. However, any presentation should focus on providing only factual information.

Winding up a scheme
Key points
If you’re considering closing a pension scheme to either new members or to future accruals, you should discuss this with the trustees or managers of your pension scheme to understand any changes that may be required to the trust deed and rules of the scheme to effect this change and, if applicable, undertake a consultation with the affected members of the scheme.
If you’re winding up a defined benefit (DB) scheme you need to understand what the consequences are and whether a debt under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 (section 75 debt) may become due.
Closing a scheme to new members or future accruals
As mentioned in funding your defined benefit scheme , if you're considering closing your scheme to new members or to further benefit accruals, whether it be a DB or defined contribution (DC) scheme, these should be discussed with the trustees or managers of your pension scheme.
The scheme’s trust deed or rules may require amendment to effect this change and, depending on how many employees you have, as the employer you may also be required to consult affected employees before making these changes as they are considered 'listed changes' under the applicable regulations.
Statement Employer duty to consult on scheme changes (PDF, 29kb, 2 pages)
Statement issued during the Department for Work and Pensions' consultation period on amending regulations to give The Pensions Regulator the power to impose financial penalties for breaches of the employer consultation requirements.
The employer duty to consult is set out in sections 259-261 of the Pensions Act 2004, the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Consultation by Employers and Miscellaneous Amendment) Regulations 2006 as amended, and the Occupational Pension Schemes (Consultation by Employers) (Modification for Multi-employer Schemes) Regulations 2006.

The essential guide to automatic enrolment
The law on workplace pensions has changed. All employers are legally required to automatically enrol certain staff into a pension scheme and make contributions. You will also have to tell your staff about the scheme you put them in and allow other staff to join if they request to do so.
Prepare for automatic enrolment
Find out how to prepare for automatic enrolment with this step-by-step guide to your new legal duties.
Guidance The essential guide to automatic enrolment
Our electronic brochure outlines the main steps that you need to take to be ready for automatic enrolment. You can also find alternative non-flash and PDF formats below.

Create your action plan for automatic enrolment
This planner has been designed to help you identify what you'll need to do to prepare for automatic enrolment.
Any employer preparing for automatic enrolment should find it helpful, but it’s of particular relevance to you if:
you employ up to 249 staff
every member of staff is based in the UK
you have one Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme
you have or are planning to set up a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme.
Create your action plan
Allow plenty of time to prepare for automatic enrolment. We recommend starting 12 months before your staging date, though this will vary depending on your individual circumstances – not all employers will need to allow so much time.
Step 1
Find out your staging date
To create your action plan, you'll need your staging date. You can find it by entering your PAYE reference into our staging date tool. Even if you think you know it already, it's a good idea to double-check it prior to creating your plan.

Workplace pensions are here. Act now. It's the law.
Even if you employ just one person, you must provide a workplace pension.
The law requires all employers to provide a workplace pension for certain staff. Find out how the change in law will affect you.
What is automatic enrolment?
The law on workplace pensions has changed. Every employer with at least one member of staff now has new duties, including putting those who meet certain criteria into a workplace pension scheme and contributing towards it.
This is called automatic enrolment. It’s called this because it’s automatic for your staff – they don’t have to do anything to be enrolled into your pension scheme. But it’s not automatic for you. You need to take steps to make sure they’re enrolled.
Does the change in law affect me?
Yes, if you employ at least one member of staff, you’ll need to automatically enrol them into a pension scheme if they meet certain criteria. Get started by reading our essential guide to automatic enrolment .

Business advisers
Employers are likely to ask you for help to choose and run a good quality pension scheme for automatic enrolment.
And it’s not just about pensions – automatic enrolment will impact upon most areas of your clients' businesses. Independent financial advisers (IFAs), employee benefit consultants (EBCs), actuaries, accountants, bookkeepers and other advisers can use our guidance and resources to help their clients make the right choices.
Closing a scheme
Help your clients prepare for automatic enrolment
Whether you're a payroll professional, bookkeeper, independent financial adviser or accountant, a change in the law means that your clients may ask you about workplace pensions. Make sure you're prepared.
Not sure where to start?
What is automatic enrolment and what will my clients need to do?
Our research tells us that at least 78% of small businesses will be relying on their business adviser for help. We send all employers an essential guide to help them get started. This guide will help you understand the basics before they come to you.
View the essential guide to automatic enrolment .
How do I help my clients prepare?
The first thing you'll need to know to help your clients prepare is their staging date. When you know this you can help your clients understand what they need to do and by when.
Help your clients comply with their duties
You can help your clients comply with their duties by understanding the changes to workplace pensions law.
Closing a scheme
Find out your clients' staging dates
Your clients staging date is set in law and is the date their automatic enrolment duties come into effect. They must be prepared for this date.
When you know your clients' staging dates you can help them understand what they need to do for automatic enrolment. You can work back from this date to plan what actions need to be made and when. For a summary of your client's staging date, read what is my staging date?
How is the staging date determined?
An employer's staging date is determined by the number of persons in the largest PAYE scheme that they use, based on the data from HM Revenue and Customs held by The Pensions Regulator on 1 April 2012.
Where to find out your client's staging date
We will write to all employers to confirm their staging date but you can look up a client's staging date by entering the reference of their largest PAYE scheme into our staging date tool . Please be aware though that there are some staging date exceptions .
You can find your client's PAYE reference(s) on their P6 / P9 coding notice or on their white payslip booklet, P30BC. If they have more than one PAYE scheme you’ll need to enter the details of each one into our staging date tool individually.

Understand and inform your clients' workforce
To help automatically enrol your clients workforce you’ll need to understand the type of workforce they have and what communications will need to be sent to them.
It is important that those who meet the criteria for public funding - or indeed those with means who may be considering privately funded litigation - come to see family mediation as something more than a viable alternative to going to court.
I hope they would come to see it as the default way to resolve disputes.

Help your clients comply with their duties
You can help your clients avoid penalties by understanding how they must comply with their employer duties.
But if you're an adviser, there are third party compliance obligations which you must be aware of when carrying out these activities on behalf of your clients.
We will enforce non-compliance by issuing statutory notices and fixed or escalating penalties. Responsibility for complying with the duties ultimately lies with the employer.
Compliance and enforcement
Learn about our approach to minimising non-compliance with automatic enrolment, and how we will enforce deliberate non-compliance by reading what happens if I don't comply?
For a summary of the compliance and enforcement strategy, outlining our regulatory approach and legal powers, read our guidance on employer duties and defining the workforce (PDF, 163kb, 28 pages) .
Keeping records
There are certain records that must be kept by law, by both the employer and the pension scheme, as proof of compliance.
Read our detailed guidance on keeping records (PDF, 97kb, 13 pages) .
Create an action plan
For an overview of what your clients need to do to comply, with links to information and resources that help with each step, use our tool to create your action plan for automatic enrolment .
To remind your clients of the steps they should have already completed six months before their staging date, you can send them our six month checkpoint leaflet (PDF, 42kb, 2 pages) . A Welsh version of the six month checkpoint leaflet (PDF, 145kb, 2 pages) is also available.
Safeguards and employer duties
Some of the safeguards came into effect from 1 July 2012, so all employers must be compliant now and not just from their staging date – make sure your clients are aware of this.
Support your clients to comply with the new employer duties by reading our detailed guidance on safeguarding individuals (PDF, 104kb, 17 pages) .

Help your clients set up business software systems
Many of the functions necessary to comply with automatic enrolment duties are process-driven.
Your clients will need to know which of their staff they have to automatically enrol and which will have a right to request to join, and software will help your clients to know this.
Business software
Business software, eg payroll, HR and pensions administration could be set up to automate the majority of these processes, such as monitoring your client's staff ages, earnings and deducting pension contributions.
If you are an accountant or bookkeeper who manages payroll for your clients, check with the provider when the system will be ready to handle the requirements of automatic enrolment. If it won't be ready, or the functionality isn't going to be made available in time, you may wish to consider an additional software package that will perform the required tasks and integrate it into their payroll software.
Will your clients be using software to automate the majority of the processes? If yes – it is crucial that they hold accurate information about their staff, eg their personal and address information and the contributions that have been made on their behalf.
Software developer guidance
Your clients are likely to need software to help them correctly identify their duties they have for each of their staff.
Whilst this isn't a resource for advisers or administrators, if you're talking to your clients about business software providers having the functionality in place to support automatic enrolment, you could direct your clients or the software developers to our guide for software developers . This detailed guide shows how to update products to automate some or all of the processes necessary to manage automatic enrolment.

Enrolment and managing the scheme
A specific process must be followed to enrol workers into the chosen scheme. Once active membership has been achieved, there are ongoing responsibilities that you may be involved in, such as ensuring contributions are paid on time and that any opt-out or opt-in notices are processed and accurate records maintained.
Employers must also follow the automatic enrolment process for anyone who asks to opt in. For an explanation of the automatic enrolment process, please read our guidance on automatic enrolment .
Opting-in and opting-out process

Both the employer and the pension scheme must, by law, keep certain records. For the records that must be kept and for how long, read our detailed guidance on keeping records (PDF, 97kb, 13 pages) .
Review existing pension arrangements
Clients with existing pension schemes may want to use them for automatic enrolment. These schemes will need to meet certain criteria, which could involve changing the scheme rules or terms and conditions. You’ll need to understand how the new legislation fits with existing pension arrangements, such as salary exchange or contractual enrolment.
Does my client’s existing scheme qualify?
To help you assess whether an existing DC scheme is a qualifying scheme and whether it can be used for automatic enrolment, please use our interactive tool: does your existing scheme qualify?
Use an existing scheme or set up a new system?
Our webinar explains qualifying schemes and discusses what you need to consider when deciding to use existing systems or putting new systems in place. It also reviews a pension scheme that qualifies for automatic enrolment. Watch our webinar on implementing automatic enrolment systems and pension schemes .

Recovery plans
Key points
Read Code of practice 3: Funding defined benefits if you advise trustees on funding, covenant and investment related matters.
Trustees should understand, monitor and manage their risks in an integrated way and you should be mindful of this when providing advice.
Help trustees adopt a proportionate approach.
Assessing the strength of the covenant now and in the future should be a key aspect of trustees’ approach.
Approach to funding
Trustees should follow a number of key funding principles as set out in Code of practice 3: Funding defined benefits. These include working closely and openly with the employer and seeking an appropriate funding outcome that reflects a reasonable balance between the need to pay promised benefits and minimising any adverse impact on an employer’s plans for sustainable growth (and therefore its long-term ability to support the scheme).
Risk taking can be acceptable but it’s vital that trustees and the employer understand the risks being taken. Due to the extent to which covenant, investment and funding decisions interact with one another, trustees should adopt a proportionate and integrated approach to assessing, monitoring and addressing risks across these three areas.
As an adviser you should:
make sure your advice to trustees and employers can be easily understood
be mindful of the fact that trustees will have to join up the advice they receive across covenant, investment and funding-related matters in order to understand overall risk – so be prepared to work transparently and collaboratively with other advisers
help trustees adopt a proportionate approach under which the resources committed are in line with the benefits they’re likely to bring.

Key points
Ensure that your clients’ defined benefit (DB) schemes have adequate internal controls that enable trustees and their advisers to manage risks relating to their scheme.
Set up and maintain your own procedures and controls to ensure you provide a good service for clients.
Help to ensure that schemes have a process that enables trustees to identify, evaluate and manage risks on an ongoing basis.
Internal controls
DB schemes need to have adequate internal controls that enable trustees and their advisers to manage their scheme according to the scheme rules and the law.
You should also set up and maintain your own controls and procedures to ensure you provide a good quality, accurate service for your clients.
Internal controls for trustees and their schemes are arrangements and procedures for:
scheme administration and management
monitoring that administration and management
safe custody and security of scheme assets.
Back to top
Risk management process
DB schemes should have a process that enables trustees and their advisers to identify, evaluate and manage risks, and to monitor risk management controls. You may be asked to provide advice on this process.
Identifying risks
You may be asked to help trustees to identify the risks that are critical to the scheme and which are likely to have a significant impact on the scheme’s ability to provide member benefits if they are not managed effectively.
Areas of risk that are likely to have a significant impact on your clients’ DB schemes include:
existing controls not operating effectively
strength of the employer covenant
investment strategy
corporate changes and transactions relevant to the scheme
legal requirements
operational procedures and technical systems
scheme management (including costs) and delegated responsibilities.
Your clients should record identified risks in a risk register.
Evaluating risks
You may be asked to help trustees to develop a process for evaluating risks. This should consider the impact and likelihood of a risk occurring.
The evaluation process should enable your clients to direct resources to priority areas. Start with risks that have a high impact and a high likelihood of occurring. Areas of risk that may need to be prioritised include:
lack of trustee knowledge and understanding
deterioration of the employer covenant
poor investment governance
conflicts of interest
ineffective relations with advisers.
You may be asked to help trustees to assess which risks the scheme can absorb without the need to take further action, and which risks need to be managed.
Managing risks
You should work with your clients to ensure that internal controls are suitably designed and implemented. They need to enable trustees and their advisers to take appropriate action.
Monitoring risk management controls
You may be asked to advise trustees in relation to their need to continually review exposure to new and emerging risks. This includes significant changes in or affecting the scheme.
Trustees must make sure the risk register is reviewed at least annually and evaluate risk assessment arrangements, procedures and systems to ensure that they are still fit for purpose, taking account of any significant changes.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Work with trustees of defined benefit (DB) schemes to identify what types of member data need to be kept.
Advise clients they need adequate internal controls to maintain accurate and up-to-date member data.
Work with trustees to carry out a data review exercise regularly and create a data improvement plan.
Work with employers to ensure that they understand when they need to pass information to the scheme administrator.
Types of member data to keep
Trustees are legally required to keep certain types of information. If you’re responsible for managing your clients’ member data or advising trustees on the records they need to keep, ensure you maintain (or, as appropriate, advise the trustees to maintain) records relating to:
the date each member joined the scheme
details of all contributions received
all other payments to and from the scheme including, for example, benefit payments and payments to advisers or the employer
details of transfers of members’ benefits and related assets to and from the scheme.
Schemes also need to hold certain types of data that is common to all schemes as well as other types of data that is conditional on a number of factors. For more information about common data and conditional data, see the data to be measured in our record-keeping regulatory guidance.
Schemes need to keep records for a minimum of six years. However, some records, including both common and conditional data, will need to be kept for a much longer period.
Back to top
Internal controls
If you’re responsible for managing your clients’ scheme data, you need to have adequate internal controls that enable you to keep the data accurate and up-to-date. Ensure that your processes meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998.
Back to top
Maintaining data
You should work with trustees to carry out a data review exercise at appropriate intervals, eg annually. You or the trustees should also carry out a review when significant events occur, such as merging or winding up the scheme.
You should make sure there’s a data improvement plan to address poor quality data.
Back to top
Working with employers
If you advise the trustees you should assist them to take reasonable steps to ensure that member records are reconciled with information held by employers.
Whether you advise the trustees or the employer, ensure that they understand when the employer needs to pass information to the scheme administrator. This includes key events such as when an employee:
joins or leaves the scheme
changes their rate of contribution
changes their name, address or salary
retires from work or dies.
If an employer fails to provide the required information, you should liaise with the trustees or employer (depending on who you advise), as needed to resolve the issue. You should also consider whether you need to report the breach to us. See code of practice 1: reporting breaches of the law .
Key points
Advise trustees to review the schedule of contributions regularly and revise it when necessary.
Advise trustees to check together with their administrators that contributions are paid into defined benefit (DB) schemes according to the schedule of contributions.
Make sure that trustees contact employers promptly to alert them about a payment failure and to try and resolve it.
Advise trustees to report material late payments to us and/or consider whether to make a report yourself.
Advise employers on paying the correct contributions and when to pass information to trustees.
Schedule of contributions
Trustees must produce a schedule showing the rates of contributions payable to the scheme by or on behalf of the employer and scheme members who are accruing benefits, and the dates by which those contributions are payable.
You should advise trustees to review the schedule regularly and revise it when necessary. The scheme actuary must certify the schedule.
When you advise on the content of a schedule of contributions, you should advise the trustees to ensure that it:
is clear enough to enable trustees to monitor payments
is drafted to avoid, as far as possible, the need to refer to other scheme documents
doesn’t show any due date for member contributions later than the 22nd day of the month following deduction from pay (or the 19th day if payments aren’t made electronically)
avoids referring to the contributions covering individual augmentations or general benefit improvements, unless these were planned and due to be paid when the schedule of contributions was certified.
Schedules may contain contributions to repair a funding deficit as an additional percentage of pensionable pay.
Back to top
Monitoring contributions
You should advise trustees to check that contributions are paid into the scheme according to the schedule of contributions and to have procedures for checking contributions are paid, including reconciling them with the schedule of contributions.
Good record-keeping and adequate internal controls ensure that the scheme and the schedule of contributions are administered, maintained and managed according to the scheme rules and legal requirements. You should advise trustees to record and keep information on transactions.
Back to top
Resolving late payments
Where a payment failure occurs, you or the trustees should have an agreed process for liaising with the employer promptly to alert them about the failure and to try and resolve it. You may need to assist the trustees to find out and record the causes and circumstances of the payment failure. You should help trustees to ensure there’s a process for obtaining overdue payments and correcting administrative errors.
You or the trustees need to report a material late payment to us, usually within 10 working days of having reasonable cause to believe that it exists. You should advise the trustees to report to us using our online service Exchange .
Where there is a current or imminent danger to the payments if immediate preventative action isn’t taken, you should advise the trustees to report the failure to us by telephone as soon as you become aware of it.
The trustees must report the material late payment to members within 30 days of it being reported to us.
Circumstances which are likely to be material and which should be reported to us include where:
there’s reasonable cause to believe that the employer isn’t willing or able to pay the outstanding contributions
the reminder and recovery process has been completed without obtaining the outstanding payment
there is possible dishonesty or misuse of assets or contributions
the trustees become aware that the employer doesn’t have adequate procedures or systems in place to ensure the correct and timely payment of contributions, and the employer doesn’t appear to be taking adequate steps to remedy the situation
there is an immediate risk to members’ benefits
contributions have been outstanding for 90 days from the due date, unless it’s an infrequent administrative error that’s already corrected or will be as soon as reasonably practicable.
Back to top
Advising on employer matters
An employer must contribute in line with the schedule of contributions for their scheme. If you advise an employer you are likely to need to make sure they are aware of this responsibility and the need to have systems in place to ensure contributions are paid appropriately.
You should also ensure that the employer understands when they need to pass information to the trustees so that they are aware of changes affecting the contributions due to be paid.
Closing a scheme
Providing information to members
Advise trustees on what information they need to make available to members, prospective members and other people entitled to benefits under defined benefit pension schemes.
You may also be asked to help trustees to produce an annual report and have procedures for resolving disputes with scheme members.
On this page
Detailed guidance
Key points
You should work with trustees to ensure information about clients’ defined benefit (DB) schemes is made available to members, prospective members, other beneficiaries and other people entitled to receive information.
Trustees must make their annual report available within 7 months of the end of each scheme year.
You should work with trustees to ensure there’s a procedure for dealing with complaints and members are told about it.
Who's entitled to information
The trustees of most pension schemes have to make information available about the scheme, including how it is run and the benefits it provides.
You may be asked to help trustees to ensure they make information available to:
members – including active members, pensioner members and deferred members
prospective members
husbands, wives or civil partners of members and prospective members
other people entitled to benefits under the scheme
independent, recognised trade unions.
Back to top
When to provide information
The people listed above can usually ask for general information about the scheme and the benefits it provides, free of charge, once in any 12-month period. New members must be sent this information when they join the scheme.
Trustees also need to provide information to individuals on other occasions either automatically or if they request it, eg when a member retires, dies or leaves the scheme. They may engage you to assist with this.
Sometimes scheme events will trigger the need to give information, eg the trustees must send out certain information when a scheme starts to wind up or members are being transferred to another scheme without their consent.
Trustees must also make specific items available on request and may need your help. This includes:
the scheme's trust deed and rules, although you only need to disclose those parts that are relevant to the individual's membership or the membership the union represents
actuarial valuations
the scheme's schedule of contributions
the scheme's statement of investment principles
the trustees’ annual report and accounts.
Back to top
Annual reports and accounts
Trustees must make their annual report and accounts available on request within 7 months of the end of each scheme year. Reports should describe how a scheme has been managed and any changes which have happened in the year. They must include, amongst other things:
a copy of the audited accounts and auditor's statement
details of the trustees and how they are appointed and removed
details of the scheme's professional advisers and fund managers
an investment report, including how the investments have performed
the number and breakdown of scheme members
the number of other people entitled to benefits under the scheme
details of pension increases and how they are worked out
an address for enquiries
Back to top
Resolving disputes with members
You may be asked to help trustees to put in place a formal arrangement for considering complaints between them and:
members
someone entitled to benefits following a member’s death
individuals who were recently in one of these categories
individuals who claim to be in one of these categories.
Scheme members must be told about the internal dispute resolution (IDR) procedure.
You may be asked to advise the trustees on implementing a procedure that best suits the scheme. However, decisions on disputes should normally be made within four months.
You may be asked to advise trustees as part of their regular review of their IDR procedure to ensure it’s working effectively.
It is important that those who meet the criteria for public funding - or indeed those with means who may be considering privately funded litigation - come to see family mediation as something more than a viable alternative to going to court.
I hope they would come to see it as the default way to resolve disputes.

Key points
Ensure you have adequate arrangements in place to identify, monitor and manage your own conflicts of interest.
If you help set up a conflicts process for trustees, make sure it includes a conflicts policy, register of interest, declarations and advance planning.
Managing your own conflicts of interest
You should have adequate arrangements in place for identifying, managing and disclosing your own conflicts of interest.
You should make trustees aware of any conflicts of interest that might or do arise when you refer services or products for which you may gain some form of financial or non-financial benefits.
Ensure that trustees understand when they’re being given independent advice and when they’re being offered a service or product from a party related to an adviser.
Back to top
Trustee conflicts of interest
Actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise for trustees of DB schemes, eg when they’re involved in funding negotiations.
There may be acute or pervasive conflicts associated with a trustee’s role, eg where they are also the finance director, in respect of which they may need advice. Not all conflicts are employer related – they can also arise for trustees who, for example, are scheme members or who hold trade union representative roles.
You should help trustees to have processes in place to manage these types of issues.
Back to top
Setting up a conflicts process for trustees
Trustees may ask you to help them set up a process to identify, monitor and manage any conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts, for those involved in running their DB scheme. This includes trustees, advisers and service providers. Such a process should include the following controls:
agreeing a conflicts policy setting out the scheme's approach to dealing with conflicts – this should cover the process to identify and monitor conflicts and outline options for managing these
maintaining a register of interests for recording all actual or potential conflicts
a process for declarations when trustees, advisers and service providers are appointed, including ongoing declarations by advisers and service providers as soon as they arise and declarations at the start of trustee and sub-committee meetings
advance planning to identify conflicts that may occur in the future and available options for managing these.
Closing a scheme
Corporate changes and transactions
This page applies to you if you’re appointed by trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme to help them to understand the impact of corporate changes and transactions on their scheme.
Corporate changes and transactions include the employer selling or restructuring their business, transferring the scheme to another sponsor or leaving a multi-employer scheme.
On this page
Key points
Corporate transactions are events that may affect the employer’s finances or underlying structure.
You may be asked to provide advice to the trustees or to the employer on areas related to corporate transactions including applying for clearance, proposed abandonment arrangements and options when leaving multi-employer schemes.
Corporate transactions
Corporate transactions are employer-related or scheme-related events that may affect the employer’s finances or underlying structure, such as:
selling or restructuring their business
making a return of capital
exiting a multi-employer pension scheme.
You may be asked to advise the trustees or the employer on the impact of corporate transactions on their defined benefit (DB) pension scheme.
Back to top
Clearance
You may be asked to advise trustees whether you consider that a corporate transaction is materially detrimental to the scheme’s ability to meet its liabilities. If this is the case, the trustees should consider whether to ask the employer to consider whether it thinks it might be appropriate to apply for clearance from us. For examples of material detriment, read our code-related guidance on the material detriment test .
The clearance statement provides assurance that we won’t use our anti-avoidance powers in relation to the transaction. For more information on when employers should consider whether it might be appropriate to apply for clearance, read our regulatory guidance on clearance .
Back to top
Abandonment
Abandonment of a pension scheme is where the sponsoring employer cuts its link with the scheme without providing the scheme with sufficient funds or assets to compensate for losing the employer’s ongoing support. This could happen, for instance, when the employer carries out a significant restructuring or transfers their scheme liabilities to another employer.
You may be asked to analyse a proposed abandonment arrangement to help trustees reach a decision with other parties whether it is in the members’ best interests. Trustees should consult with us at an early stage in the process.
Back to top
Leaving multi-employer schemes
There are a number of different ways that employers can manage their obligations to their scheme if they leave a multi-employer scheme. You may be asked to provide advice to the employer to decide which option is most suitable and to the employer or to the trustees to ensure that the scheme’s liabilities will continue to be appropriately funded.
Back to top
Notifiable events
If you become aware of a failure by trustees or an employer to notify us of a notifiable event, you should report the failure to us as a breach of pensions legislation likely to be of material significance. For more information, go to our codes of practice on notifiable events and reporting breaches of the law .
If you set up and run work-based personal pensions for your clients, you have certain duties. You should also be aware of how The Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulate work-based personal pensions.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Ensure that your clients’ defined contribution schemes have adequate internal controls that enable trustees and their advisers to manage risks relating to their scheme.
Set up and maintain your own procedures and controls to ensure you provide a good service for clients.
Ensure that schemes have a process that enables trustees to identify, evaluate and manage risks on an ongoing basis.
Internal controls
You should ensure that your clients’ DC schemes have adequate internal controls that enable trustees and their advisers to manage their scheme according to the scheme rules and the law.
You should also set up and maintain your own controls and procedures to ensure you provide a good quality, accurate service for your clients.
Internal controls are arrangements and procedures for:
scheme administration and management
monitoring that administration and management
safe custody and security of scheme assets.
Back to top
Risk management process
DC schemes should have a process that enables trustees and their advisers to identify, evaluate and manage risks, and to monitor risk management controls. You may be asked to help with this process.
Identifying risks
Identify risks that are critical to the scheme and which are likely to have a significant impact on the scheme’s ability to provide member benefits if they are not managed effectively.
You should use sources of information such as audit reports, service contracts, complaints and administration reports.
Areas of risk that are likely to have a significant impact on your clients’ DC schemes include:
fraud (including pension scams and theft) and the importance of independent oversight
investment
Detailed guidance
Key points
Ensure that your clients’ defined contribution (DC) schemes have an appropriate investment strategy and offer suitable investment options.
Ensure your clients monitor and review that the investment options continue to be suitable for members and meet their objectives.
Ensure there are measures in place to protect scheme assets.
Setting investment strategy
Ensure that your clients’ schemes:
have an appropriate investment strategy and investment objectives, including a statement of investment principles
offer a default strategy for members who don’t want to choose their own investments
offer suitable investment options for members who want to make their own decisions
communicate regularly with members about their investment choices – for more information about providing good quality communications, see member communication .
Providing investment funds
If you’re responsible for advising trustees on their choice of funds, you should ensure your clients devote sufficient time to:
understanding the objectives of each investment fund
understanding fund costs and charges
documenting information about fund objectives, costs and charges
communicating fund information to members
ensuring the number and risk profile of funds offered as an alternative to the default strategy meets the needs of the membership.
You should obtain enough information from investment managers so that you’re satisfied your clients can demonstrate that they’ve understood the issues above and factored them into their solution and range of products.
Back to top
Reviewing investment strategy and fund performance
Your clients may ask you to help monitor and review that the default strategy and other investment options continue to be suitable for all members (including deferred). You should also check that all investment options meet their investment objectives.
Your clients should review the default strategy when certain events occur, eg changes to the membership demographics or sustained changes in market conditions.
Your clients should decide how often to review each investment fund and the type of review. They should base their decision on factors such as size, value and type of fund.
They should consider setting mechanical triggers, eg to identify whether a fund is underperforming against its benchmark. They should make sure triggers are appropriate to the long-term nature of pension scheme investments.
You should advise them to:
assess fund performance against objectives
compare fund returns to industry benchmarks
check that fund fees are competitive
monitor levels of portfolio turnover
ensure there are controls to alert them to potential risks
ensure they assess regularly the investment decision-making and governance process.
If the trustees (using your advice) decide to change investment funds or investment manager, you need to consider the most suitable transition option.
Protecting scheme assets
Ensure that your clients’ schemes:
invest predominantly in assets regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority or a similar overseas regulatory authority
assess the compensation and protection arrangements for the scheme’s investment funds and products
consider mitigation, eg insurance or financial guarantees, if investments with inadequate protection are kept
balance the risks associated with illiquid assets with their potential for higher investment returns.

Working with employers
Make sure trustees take reasonable steps to ensure that member records are reconciled with information held by employers.
Ensure that employers understand when they need to provide trustees with information. This includes key events such as when an employee:
joins or leaves the scheme
changes their rate of contribution
changes their name, address or salary
retires from work or dies.
If an employer fails to provide the required information, the trustees and you should consider whether you need to report the breach to us. See code of practice 1: reporting breaches of the law .
Ensure defined contribution (DC) schemes handle contributions and financial transactions promptly and accurately.
Ensure member data is held securely and there are effective disaster recovery plans in place.
Ensure that there is an appropriate and robust retirement process in place.
Contributions
Ensure that your clients’ schemes have a payment schedule. Check that employer and employee contributions are paid according to the schedule and that trustees seek to recover any contributions that haven’t been paid in full or on time. For more information about trustees’ responsibilities, go to maintaining contributions .
Your clients’ schemes should offer flexible contribution options that enable members to vary their contributions. Options that the employer may want to offer members include additional contributions, match funding or salary sacrifice.
Ensure that members are regularly informed that their level of contributions is a key factor in determining the size of their pension fund.
Back to top
Processing core scheme financial transactions
Your clients’ schemes should have adequate internal controls to ensure that all core scheme financial transactions are processed promptly and accurately. These transactions include:
bulk transfers in and out
member fund switches and redirections
receipt of contributions
member unitisations and investment of contributions
investment and disinvestment of scheme assets
individual transfers in and out quotes and payments
benefits payable on death
purchase of annuities and payments of lump sums.
You should be able to show trustees how your arrangements ensure that the scheme meets legal requirements relating to the services you provide.

Managers of personal pension schemes
Managers of personal pension schemes can be:
The personal pension scheme operator or provider, namely the person responsible to members for managing and administering the assets and income of, and the benefits payable under the scheme in accordance with pensions and tax legislation, the scheme’s provisions and the regulatory system. Typically, but not always, this is the appointed scheme administrator.
Trustees operating a scheme jointly with the scheme administrator due to their responsibilities under the scheme trust deed for administering and managing the assets.
Other parties liable as scheme administrator, and the persons responsible for the management of the scheme (other than a scheme established under trust).

Codes and guidance
We’ve updated our codes of practice on reporting late payment of contributions to defined contribution (DC) occupational and personal pension schemes and accompanying guidance.
The codes and the accompanying guidance aim to improve transparency and ensure that everyone involved in the flow of contributions has a clear understanding of their responsibilities.
Back to top
Understand your obligations
It’s important that you understand your obligation to effectively monitor the pension scheme. In particular you need to know when to report a payment failure to us, what constitutes a ‘materially significant payment failure’, and when and how to report a payment failure.
You need to ensure that you:
take responsibility for monitoring contributions
take steps to recover and remedy missed or late payments quickly and efficiently
ensure you report any materially significant payment failures to the regulator in good time.
You will also have to inform your members if such a payment failure occurs. This is a legal duty.
What you must report
Examples of material payment failures that you need to report to us:
Where managers have reasonable cause to believe that the employer is not willing to pay the outstanding contributions. Where the managers’ reminder and recovery process has been exhausted without response from the employer or without them having obtained the outstanding payment they may assume this indicates an employer’s unwillingness to pay.
Where there is a payment failure involving possible dishonesty or a misuse of assets or contributions. For example, managers may have concerns that the employer is retaining and using contributions to assist cash flow difficulties or where managers have become aware that the employer has transferred contributions elsewhere other than to the scheme.
Where there is a failure to pay contributions which carries a criminal penalty. For example, information available to the managers may indicate that the employer is knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the obligation to pay employee contributions.
Where the managers become aware that the employer does not have adequate procedures or systems in place to ensure the correct and timely payment of contributions due and the employer appears not to be taking adequate steps to remedy the situation, for example where there are repetitive and regular payment failures.
In any event where contributions have been outstanding for 90 days from the due date.
What you don't need to report
Examples of what you shouldn’t normally report to us:
Where managers have entered into a payment arrangement with the employer for the recovery of the outstanding contributions and the employer is paying in accordance with that arrangement.
Where a claim has been submitted to the Redundancy Payments Office National Insurance Fund or the Northern Ireland Redundancy Payments Service.
Where there are infrequent one-off payment failures or administrative errors resulting from, for example employees leaving the scheme or employment, new employees joining, or changes in salary not being notified promptly to the managers, and those occasional failures or errors have been corrected within 90 days of the due date.
Where payments are made in excess of the contributions due under the direct payment arrangements.
Where contributions are paid late but in full and within 90 days of the due date.

How to report material payment failures
This section provides you with information on how to use our maintaining contributions online service to report individual or multiple material payment failures from employers to your DC scheme.
Using this online service will help you ensure that you're able to report your material payment failures in line with our published codes of practice and guidance .
There are two different ways to report, depending on your role and the nature of the report that you need to make. You can either submit a single report or a bulk report.
Single report: we recommend using this option when you have a small number of material payment failures to report.
Bulk report: we recommend using this option when you have a large number of material payment failures to report to save you time on entering data. You can download a copy of our standardised data template once you're logged in to the service. Our template below contains information on the data you must provide, along with some additional guidance.

Trustee conflicts of interest
Trustee conflicts of interest can arise in DC schemes. They may arise, for example, when agreeing operational costs such as those relating to administration or communication with employers.
You should ensure that representation on the trustee board is as balanced as possible.
Some DC trust-based schemes, particularly those set up by insurers, appoint a trustee who is an employee of the product provider. If a provider-appointed trustee becomes aware of any business-related decisions which have a bearing on the scheme, ensure they consider the impact this may have on their role as a trustee.

Setting up a conflicts process for trustees
Trustees may ask you to help them set up a process to identify and manage any conflicts of those involved in running their defined contribution (DC) scheme. This includes trustees, advisers and service providers. You should ensure the process includes the following controls:
conflicts policy setting out the schemes’ approach to dealing with conflicts
register of interests for recording all actual or potential conflicts
declarations when trustees, advisers and service providers are appointed, ongoing declarations by advisers and service providers as soon as they arise, declarations at the start of trustee and sub-committee meetings
advance planning to identify conflicts that may occur in the future.

Key points
A scheme offers value for money where the costs of membership provide good value in relation to the benefits of membership, when compared to other options available in the market.
Encourage trustees of defined contribution (DC) schemes to consider value for money on an ongoing basis and to carry out a regular strategic review.
Improve issues within your scope and raise any ancillary concerns with trustees or the relevant party.
What is value for money?
A scheme offers value for money where the costs and charges deducted from members provide good value in relation to the benefits and services they receive, when compared to other options available in the market. For instance, if a client’s scheme has higher costs and charges it should offer improved benefits and services.
There is no common definition of what represents value for money. You need to understand what members will value most when assessing the overall value of the scheme and its individual components.
Costs and charges
Costs and charges have a significant impact on members’ pension savings, but calculating them can be complex. Make sure you and the trustees understand all the costs and charges that apply to the scheme or the investment funds used by the scheme. For more information, go to costs and charges .
Back to top
Setting up schemes that provide value for money
If you’re involved with setting up new pension arrangements for your clients, you should ensure they will offer value for money to members. Go to setting up a scheme .
Back to top
Assessing value for money
You may be asked by trustees to help them assess whether their existing scheme offers value for money to members.
Ensure trustees keep value for money in mind on an ongoing basis by getting them to include it on the scheme’s risk register.
Ensure trustees carry out a regular strategic review, eg every three years. They should take a proportionate and cost-effective approach by using ongoing information from service providers and publicly available information.
They should document the results of assessments as evidence of activity in this area.
Improving value for money
Trustees should improve issues where they have responsibility. They may ask you to help with other areas.
If there are concerns that are not within your scope to resolve, you or the trustees should raise them with the employer or the party that needs to resolve them.
Trustees or the employer may decide that scheme members will be better served by:
requiring improved service levels

Communicating with members and employers
Ensure that trustees clearly disclose to members all costs and charges that are deducted from their pension funds, throughout their membership.
If the employer is considering whether to offer membership of an existing DC trust-based scheme to their staff, make sure that trustees provide clear and accurate information about costs and charges to the employer at the point of selection.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Ensure key information is communicated to scheme members regularly to keep them informed and to enable them to make decisions.
Ensure communications are accurate, clear, understandable and engaging.
What to communicate to members
You may issue communications on behalf of trustees or you may be asked by trustees to help them provide information to members.
Make sure that certain information is communicated to members. This includes:
basic information within two months of the member joining, or one month if they have been automatically enrolled – including an explanation of lifestyling where it is offered by the scheme, when it is likely to be adopted, and outlining its advantages and disadvantages
a statutory money purchase illustration showing, for example, the member’s projected pension and an annual benefit statement providing details of contributions credited to the member in the preceding scheme year
certain documents on request, eg trustees annual report, scheme rules, statement of investment principles, and ad hoc benefit statements and transfer values
where the scheme offers lifestyling, an explanation of it and when it is likely to be adopted (or if it has been adopted) five to 15 years before a member retires, and its advantages and disadvantages
information about selecting an annuity from an insurance company of the member’s choice (the open market option) at least four months before their expected retirement date
information when other specific events happen, eg when a member leaves the scheme or the scheme winds up.
You should also ensure that scheme members receive information about:
their current investment strategy and why they need to review the suitability of their investment choices
how their level of contributions is a key factor in determining the overall size of their pension fund
costs and charges.

Providing good quality communications
The retirement outcome that a member receives is more likely to be improved when they engage on key issues. Your client should make sure that communications meet the needs of members from when they join the scheme until when they retire.
Many members have little or no interest in their pension until they reach retirement. Therefore, your client should ensure that member communications are accurate, clear, understandable and engaging. Focus on providing the right information, at the right time using the right channel.
Consider how best to use resources such as a scheme website, email, the company intranet, webinars and podcasts, mobile phone applications and text messages.
You and / or the trustees should work with the employer. For instance, you may wish to issue joint communications from the employer and the trustee.
Planning
Encourage trustees to document their approach to communications in a plan. This could set out communication objectives, how they will be achieved and who is responsible for the different aspects of communications.
Monitoring
Ensure your client reviews scheme communications regularly, eg once a year, and when legislation changes. Monitor how effective they are in achieving their objectives and take action when they don’t meet their objectives.
Ensure that the trustees include member communications as an item in their risk register. Go to risk management .
Detailed guidance
Key points
Ensure trustees give defined contribution (DC) scheme members the option of selecting a retirement product (eg an annuity) from an insurance company of their choice.
Make sure trustees set up a process that enables them to communicate information about choosing the most appropriate retirement options.
Ensure trustees provide members with access to an adviser or annuity broker, or they give them information to make their own decisions.
Providing support to members
If you are an independent financial adviser (IFA) or annuity broker, trustees may ask you to help members make decisions at retirement. You should liaise with the trustees or employer as necessary.
In accordance with Financial Conduct Authority rules, you must confirm and agree the costs with the member before you conduct investment business.
Providing support to trustees
Open market option
Make sure that members are made aware of the open market option at least four months before their expected retirement date. This means giving members the option of selecting an annuity from an insurance company of their choice and one other than they saved with.
Retirement process
Work with trustees to set up a retirement process that helps members to receive a good outcome from their pension savings. The process should ensure you start communicating with members a number of years before they retire. Make sure trustees consider:
deferred and active members
members with small and large pots
members with multiple pots
members choosing to retire at different ages, including those retiring in difficult circumstances, such as ill health.
The process should set out the key activities, timeframes and who is responsible for them. It could include the following stages:
ensure the member understands retirement
ensure the member understands the different ways to take retirement income
ensure the member understands how to buy products
implement member’s decisions
review the retirement process and monitor outcomes.
Make sure the process enables you or the trustees to act without delay and that members purchasing annuities on the open market are made aware they need to act promptly to avoid missing out on the best rates.
Types of support
To support scheme members at retirement you could either provide access to an IFA or annuity broker, or provide information so that members can make their own decisions.
You may wish to refer members to information from organisations such as the Money Advice Service or the Pensions Advisory Service to help them make their decisions.
Your pension: it’s time to choose is a useful guide from the Money Advice Service for DC scheme members who are close to retiring and have a pension pot to convert into retirement income.
Closing a scheme
Quality assurance
Check the quality of your clients’ defined contribution schemes so that you and the trustees can demonstrate to employers and scheme members that you’re running a quality scheme which is more likely to deliver good retirement outcomes.
Trustees of master trusts may ask you for help with independently assuring their scheme.
Register new schemes, check schemes meet the FCA’s rules and ensure contributions are paid.
The Pensions Regulator and the FCA primarily share regulation of work-based personal pensions.
We are working with employers, providers, managers and the FCA to meet our statutory objectives such as to protect members’ benefits.
Setting up and running work-based personal pensions
Make sure that you register new schemes with HM Revenue and Customs and The Pensions Regulator and that they meet certain legal and quality criteria. Go to setting up a scheme .
If you set up and manage work-based personal pensions for clients, you should ensure that the schemes meet the FCA’s rules and regulations. You can find more information on the FCA website .
If you manage work-based personal pensions you have a specific role to play in ensuring that contributions to the schemes are paid. For more information, go to maintaining contributions .

Regulating work-based personal pensions
The Pensions Regulator regulates occupational trust-based schemes. We share the task of regulating work-based personal pensions with the FCA.
The FCA is responsible for regulating the conduct of pension scheme and investment product providers.
The Pensions Regulator has statutory objectives including to protect the benefits of members of personal pension schemes where there is a direct payment arrangement. To do this we are working with:
employers, eg providing guidance to help them choose a good quality scheme
providers, eg encouraging them to use product and investment governance committees
FCA to ensure that regulation is joined up, quality standards are consistent and the regulatory framework offers similar levels of member protection regardless of how a pension is provided.
Our analysis suggests that there is a high level of alignment between the FCA’s rules and regulatory expectations for providers and our regulatory expectations on scheme quality (as defined by our DC principles and quality features that underpin the DC code and DC regulatory guidance). Go to initial analysis of the DC quality features in FSA regulation of work-based personal pensions (PDF, 116kb) .
Ensuring robust systems and processes
Key points
You need to have an in-depth understanding of the scheme structure so that you can advise on how to manage potential risks.
Ensure there are robust systems and processes in place to separately identify and manage the assets attributable to each type of benefit.
Types of hybrid scheme
Hybrid schemes include a combination of DB and DC benefits. Examples include:
separate DB and DC sections under one trust
DB scheme with a DC underpin, eg a scheme that will pay a member the better of their DB or DC benefit
DC scheme with a contracted out element on a DB basis
DB schemes with a DC top-up.
Back to top
Potential risks to members
To advise on how to manage a hybrid scheme you need to have an in-depth understanding of the scheme structure and the benefits the scheme offers.
If you do not understand and don’t advise your client how to manage the scheme appropriately, members will face a number of potential risks:
lack of governance
unclear and incorrect member communication
incorrect benefits and funding levels
inappropriate investment strategies
Back to top
Checking the status of money purchase benefits
The statutory definition of money purchase benefits changed with effect from 24 July 2014. Schemes may be affected by this change if they offer benefits that have the potential to develop a funding deficit, ie non-money purchase benefits.
You may be asked by clients to provide advice on how the changes affect their scheme. For more information on the amendments, see our statement on changes to the definition of a money purchase benefit:
Statement Changes to the definition of money purchase benefits (PDF, 69kb, 5 pages)
Published: July 2014
Back to top
Ensuring robust systems and processes
You need to advise your clients to exercise good governance over the scheme by having robust systems and processes in place. This will ensure they can separately identify the assets attributable to each type of benefit. Where you undertake services outsourced by your client you should also have robust systems and processes in place.
If you are a scheme administrator you should carry out the following actions.
Use separate bank accounts for DB and DC monies to avoid mixing assets.
Provide information to trustees that shows the DC assets are identifiable at all times. Report regularly on the robustness of systems and processes to ensure that DC assets are separately identifiable.
Ensure member communications clearly state the different benefits held for members, including what happens in the event of a scheme wind-up.
Provide reports on regular reconciliation of DC and DB assets carried out and cash flow statements, detailing movement of monies at a DC member level.
Offer the open market option and statutory money purchase illustration to members with DC entitlements in line with legal requirements.
Ensure individual member data accurately reflects and separates DB and DC entitlements.
If you are an employee benefit consultant or other adviser you should carry out the following actions.
Ensure advice to trustees on hybrid structures states the advantages and disadvantages of such schemes and considers the employer’s future growth strategies.
Offer appropriate investment choices to DC members that consider the member population’s risk appetite. Where the same investment funds are used for DB and DC members, the approach should be justified and there should be clear segregation of assets.
Ensure advice to trustees and employers states the winding up strategies for hybrid schemes, their complexities and the different safeguards (including Pension Protection Fund) offered to DB and DC members.
In general, you must manage the DB elements of hybrid schemes as if they were a DB scheme and manage the DC elements as if they were a DC scheme. Go to the sections on DB scheme management and DC scheme management .

Quality criteria
When deciding whether a scheme is good quality, you should focus on certain key areas including simplicity, investment options, managing investments, value for money, the provider and communications. For more information, see our guides for financial advisers and accountants:
Accountant's guide to pension scheme selection and automatic enrolment (PDF, 64kb, 7 pages)
The six DC principles
The key areas are encompassed within six principles that we expect all DC schemes to adopt during their design, set up and ongoing operation:
Principle 1 – schemes are designed to be durable, fair and deliver good outcomes for members
Principle 2 – a comprehensive scheme governance framework is established at set-up, with clear accountabilities and responsibilities agreed and made transparent
Principle 3 – those who are accountable for scheme decisions and activity understand their duties and are fit and proper to carry them out
Principle 4 – schemes benefit from effective governance and monitoring through their full lifecycle
Principle 5 – schemes are well administered with timely, accurate and comprehensive processes and records
Principle 6 – communication to members is designed and delivered to ensure members are able to make informed decisions about their retirement savings.
DC quality features
Those designing and running DC schemes should be able to demonstrate that they have embedded 31 DC quality features. These set out in further detail the activities, behaviours and control processes which we expect to see in DC schemes that are more likely to deliver good member outcomes.
The quality features underpin the six DC principles as follows.
Principle 1: essential characteristics
Those running schemes will:
ensure that all members receive value for money
ensure that all costs and charges borne by members are transparent and communicated clearly at point of selection to the employer to enable value for money comparisons to be made and to assess the fairness to members of the costs and charges
understand and put arrangements in place to mitigate the impact to members of business and/or commercial risks
predominantly invest in assets admitted to trading on regulated markets: where unregulated investment options are offered, it must be demonstrable why it was appropriate to offer those investment options
understand the levels of financial protection available to members and carefully consider situations where compensation is not available
ensure that schemes offer flexible contribution structures that give members the option to pay more
ensure that a default strategy is provided which is suitable for the needs of the membership
ensure that the number and risk profile of investment options offered reflects the needs of the membership
ensure that investment objectives for each investment option are identified and documented in order for them to be regularly monitored
ensure that a process is provided which helps members to optimise their income at retirement.
Principle 2: establishing governance
Those running schemes will:
ensure that sufficient time and resources are identified and made available for maintaining the ongoing governance of the scheme
support employers in understanding their responsibilities for providing accurate information, on a timely basis, to scheme advisers and service providers
ensure that accountability and delegated responsibilities for all elements of running the scheme are identified, documented and understood by those involved
establish and maintain procedures and controls to ensure the effectiveness and performance of the services offered by scheme advisers and service providers (also under principle 4)
establish and maintain adequate internal controls which mitigate significant operational, financial, regulatory and compliance risks (also under principle 4)
ensure that arrangements are established to review the ongoing appropriateness of investment options.
Principle 3: people
understand their duties and be fit and proper to carry them out
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries
be able to effectively demonstrate how they manage conflicts of interest.
Principle 4: ongoing governance and monitoring
Those running schemes will:
regularly review their skills and competencies to demonstrate they understand their duties and are fit and proper to carry them out
establish and maintain procedures and controls to ensure the effectiveness and performance of the services offered by scheme advisers and service providers (also under principle 2)
establish and maintain adequate internal controls which mitigate significant operational, financial, regulatory and compliance risks (also under principle 2)
take appropriate steps to monitor contributions and resolve contributions which have not been paid in accordance with the payment schedule in full on or before the due date
monitor the ongoing suitability of the default strategy for the membership
ensure that the performance of each investment option, including the default strategy, is regularly assessed against stated investment objectives.
Principle 5: administration
Those running schemes will:
ensure that member data across all membership categories is complete and accurate and is subject to regular data evaluation
ensure that core scheme financial transactions are processed promptly and accurately
ensure that administration systems are able to cope with scale and are underpinned by adequate business and disaster recovery arrangements.
Principle 6: communication to members
Those running schemes will:
ensure that all costs and charges borne by members are clearly disclosed to members
ensure that members are regularly informed that their level of contributions is a key factor in determining the overall size of their pension fund
ensure that scheme communication is accurate, clear, understandable and engaging and it addresses the needs of members from joining to retirement
ensure that members are regularly made aware of their current investment strategy and what this means for them
clearly communicate to members the options available at retirement in a way which supports them in choosing the option most appropriate to their circumstances.

Whistleblowing
You may have concerns that need to be raised with us outside of your statutory or professional obligations. This could include circumstances where you are concerned about the conduct of the company you work for.
See below for details on how to report your concern using our whistleblowing service.
Online service Whistleblowing form
Use our online whistleblowing form to report a concern about a work-based pension scheme. Alternatively, you can email us with details of your concern at wb@tpr.gov.uk or call us on 0845 600 7060.
Will my identity become known?
We understand that when you supply information to us it may have a potential impact on the relationship between you and those you are reporting, particularly in the case of a worker and their employer.
You can always choose to be anonymous when reporting concerns to us so no one will know your identity. However, it is useful to have your contact details in case we need to ask you for more information while we investigate your concerns. There is whistleblowing protection under the Employment Rights Act 1996 which protects most employees if they raise a concern about wrongdoing – either internally or with a regulator.
Will my identity be protected if I report a concern?
We will do our best to protect your identity (if desired) and will not disclose it except where lawfully required to do so. We will take all reasonable steps to maintain confidentiality but we cannot give any categorical assurances as circumstances may mean that disclosure of your identity becomes unavoidable – for example if we are ordered by a court to disclose it.
What happens after I report a concern?
After you report your concern to us we will start making some initial inquires and we may contact you to clarify information (if you provide your contact details). We do not encourage you to try and get any new information.
If appropriate, we will refer your concern internally for investigation. However, due to legal restrictions we’re unable to provide you with any feedback about our investigation. If you’re reporting an employer or third party we’ll ensure you have a designated point of contact and any witnesses are supported throughout any enforcement process.

Next steps if you have concerns about pension scams
Contact the pension scheme member to establish whether they understand the type of scheme they’ll be transferring to and send them the pension scams scorpion booklet .
Speak to the member at risk – over the phone, via email or letter. It could help you establish answers to more of the questions in the checklist in the pension scams action pack , where you’ve been unable to answer them with the information you have available.
Direct the member to Action Fraud if you think it’s a pension scam, or the Pensions Advisory Service who can help them understand the potential tax consequences of the transfer if any part of the arrangement is deemed as unauthorised.
If the member insists on proceeding with their transfer request, and your concerns remain, then you should alert Action Fraud yourself. There could still be time to protect this member, or others who follow in their footsteps.
Closing a scheme
Closing a scheme
We provide good practice guidance to help trustees and others meet the two-year timeframe in relation to winding up occupational pension schemes.
Trustees must ensure effective and efficient management of the scheme through wind-up and, in turn, enable at least the key activities to be completed as soon as reasonably practical (and within 2 years).

Approaching funding
The trustees’ approach to scheme funding cannot be implemented in isolation from their fiduciary and other duties (under both the rules of their scheme and legislation or trust law). The circumstances of both the scheme and employer are also crucial.
The trustees’ key objective is to pay promised benefits as they fall due. They may also have additional aims: for example, maintaining the relationship between the scheme and employer, de-risking or (where required, with employer agreement) the preservation of ongoing benefit accrual.
Trustees must have appropriate knowledge and understanding of the principles which relate to scheme funding[15] to understand the possible funding approaches for their scheme.
Part 3 provides the statutory framework for how the trustees must assess their scheme’s liabilities and determine the pace and period over which these liabilities must be funded. Part 3 sits alongside the scheme’s own funding rules[16]. As there is no single typical scheme, the funding solution under Part 3 will always be scheme-specific.
The responsibilities of trustees and the employer
Whilst it is the trustees who take the decisions on a scheme’s funding position and who must be comfortable that certain statutory tests are met[17], agreement must normally be reached with the employer on the contents of the funding documents[18].
Collaborative working
Trustees and employers should therefore work together in an open and transparent manner to reach funding solutions that strike the right balance between the needs of the scheme and those of the employer. They should engage early and often. This engagement will be valuable even where not mandated. Where negotiation is necessary, it is important to work together as partners to explore whether it is possible to reach agreement.
To form their views, the trustees should engage with and obtain relevant information from the employer at an early stage in the valuation process. In turn the employer must provide the trustees with the information they or their professional advisers reasonably require to perform their respective duties[19]. This includes information reasonably required to assess the employer covenant. Employers will appreciate the value of volunteering information about their plans (including those for growth) so that these can be considered when reaching funding decisions.
Trustees should not be refused information to which they are otherwise entitled because of concerns over stock exchange requirements or other confidentiality issues[20]. They should, however, be aware of the potentially sensitive nature of the information and any constraints on disclosure by the employer. Potential employer concerns can be overcome by the trustees entering into a confidentiality agreement with the employer and/or using trustee sub-committees. Where constraints on disclosure exist, trustees should co-operate with the employer in taking steps to overcome those restraints where possible.
Managing conflicts
Managing conflicts of interests and duties properly is vital. Trustees should have a process in place which effectively identifies, documents, monitors and manages conflicts and potential conflicts.
Given the importance and sensitivity of funding negotiations, trustees need to understand when actual or potential conflicts arise. Where conflicted, a trustee should consider withdrawing from negotiations. Where there are acute or pervasive conflicts or tensions associated with the trustee’s role (for example where the trustee is also the finance director) it is likely to be inappropriate for the trustee to continue to be involved in those negotiations. Not all conflicts are employer-related. They can also arise for trustees who, for example, are members of the scheme or who hold trade union representative roles.
Trustees also need to be aware that their service providers and advisers could also have conflicts. Where a conflict is identified to the trustees they should understand how it is being managed.
Agreeing a funding solution
It is important that trustees are always able to demonstrate that they have acted in line with their fiduciary duties in an impartial, independent manner when complying with the requirements of Part 3. In the unlikely event that those requirements are not met (even after engagement and collaborative working between both parties) then the trustees should not agree the actuarial valuation as they would be compromising the scheme’s funding position.
A limited number of schemes may not be able to put in place an adequate scheme funding solution (ie one which is appropriate in the context of the employer covenant without an unacceptable level of investment risk being run). The trustees of these schemes should be prepared to address the implications of this for paying benefits. Continued future accrual of benefits is unlikely to be appropriate. Other consequences might include consideration of whether the scheme should be wound up or how the scheme’s interests in the employer are protected or realised.
Trustees should document their considerations and reasons for decisions. They should be in a position to be able to explain the decisions based on the interplay of the different information and advice strands they have received.
When performing their duties under Part 3, trustees should not take into account the potential for the PPF to provide compensation to members of the scheme.

An integrated approach to risk management
It is not necessary to eradicate risks completely. Trustees may wish to embrace a degree of risk in seeking opportunities to capture potentially significant associated rewards for both the scheme and employer. Accepting appropriate risk can significantly help to minimise any adverse impact on the employer’s sustainable growth which in turn helps the trustees to meet their key funding objective to pay promised benefits.
Risk should be understood and managed appropriately. Trustees should understand the likely upsides and downsides of proposals and be comfortable with the extent to which the employer can address the likely adverse outcomes over an appropriate period. Trustees should engage with the employer to establish its appetite for risk and tolerance to downside events. Trustees should note that it is not necessary for the employer to be able to cover all conceivable risks or that those it is covering be repaired immediately should they crystallise.
Assessing risk
If they are not already doing so, trustees should adopt a proportionate[21] integrated approach to risk management when developing an appropriate scheme funding solution. The resources committed to this should be commensurate with the benefits the approach is expected to deliver for the scheme and employer.
Schemes face many risks to achieving their funding plans. These broadly fall into those which are:
employer covenant-related
investment-related and
funding-related.
As part of a risk management approach, trustees should understand the risks across all of these strands and define acceptable parameters for each within which they seek to manage the scheme. This understanding also helps the trustees to strike the right balance between these risk parameters.
In general, employer covenant, funding and investment decisions interact so that a material change to one affects the other two. Trustees should proportionately[22] monitor key indicators so that, where such a change occurs, they can make timely adjustments (if appropriate) designed to preserve the scheme’s funding balance.
An integrated approach does not need to be expensive or standalone. Some aspects may already be, and continue to be, recorded within either or both of the statement of funding principles and the statement of investment principles for the scheme. The focus should not be on paperwork or excessive quantification. Instead the approach should be embedded within the trustees’ governance framework. Emphasis should be placed on the actions trustees should take when risks begin to crystallise.
Risk management in the funding landscape
Effective integrated risk management is an internal control for the scheme and represents an appropriate scheme risk management cycle[23]. Once they have set objectives for scheme funding, trustees should:
understand the employer covenant, investment and funding risks to those objectives and the interaction between these risks
have a funding and investment strategy to achieve these objectives
set an appropriate risk appetite
agree appropriate management actions and contingency plans; and
establish a framework to assess, monitor and control:
scheme risks
progress against the trustees’ strategy; and
any changes required.
Integrated risk management steps
Understanding risks
Trustees should seek to understand the risks across the employer covenant, investment and funding strands. In particular trustees should understand the extent of the scheme’s reliance on the employer covenant over time on the basis of a range of plausible future scenarios. These scenarios should capture investment risk, the impact of potential or actual maturing of the scheme and the impact of the contribution patterns which are proposed for the scheme (and the risks to those contribution patterns) compared to the employer covenant available under various scenarios. This is because the employer underwrites both the short- and long-term risks to which a scheme is exposed.
Tools for understanding risks
It is important for trustees to appreciate that all the risk assessment tools only illustrate possible outcomes. They do not predict how a scheme’s assets and liabilities will behave. Their value lies in helping trustees to appreciate the order of magnitude of the scheme risks, the broad trade-offs and the options available for managing these risks. Trustees should assess and weigh the inputs they receive relative to the various other inputs. They are encouraged to use a variety of qualitative and quantitative approaches (for example, scenario testing and stress testing) to assess the impact of adverse events on potential employer covenant, investments and funding plans. The approaches used should be proportionate[24] to scheme and employer circumstances.
Approaching risks
When approaching the assessment of risk, trustees should remember that pensions are deferred pay. If the funding strategy is unsuccessful and the employer is unable to make up the shortfall this deferred pay will not be delivered.
It is useful for trustees to consider how other organisations, which find themselves in a position of being creditors (such as banks), seek to protect themselves against the risk of the non-payment of money owed by counterparties. Applying some of these techniques to the scheme’s circumstances could result in the provision of adequate and risk-controlled collateral or guarantees (the scheme’s actual and contingent assets) and/or the use of controls around employer behaviour (for example, negative pledges and monitoring).
Setting strategies
Strategies set by the trustees should be specific, measurable, appropriate, realistic and time-bound. Setting acceptable strategies involves establishing the balance between the risks which they consider to be appropriate for the scheme given its and the employer’s circumstances. Trustees should consider a wide range of questions and issues such as:
what risks are controllable and what are not
the likelihood and consequences of each of these being realised
what risks they are prepared to take
what risks would they like to mitigate in full or in part
proposed risk controls and volatility of results; and
vulnerability of the scheme and the employer covenant.
This analysis should enable trustees, in discussion with the employer, to identify material risks and set parameters within which they seek to manage the scheme risks. The ability of the trustees to take different levels of risk dependent on their appetite should be informed by their assessment of the employer’s own tolerance to risk. The trustees’ ability to manage and address these risks, is a key flexibility which can be used to minimise any adverse impact on an employer’s sustainable growth. The level of tolerable risk and the flexibilities set by the trustees should be consistent with their key objective to pay promised benefits.
Monitoring risk
Effective risk management should be an ongoing process. Material changes can occur between actuarial valuations.
This is why trustees should have a framework in place to apply proportionately[25] when it comes to on-going monitoring. This should enable them to quickly identify changes in the environment and balance of risks.
Employer covenant, investment performance and scheme funding levels can change rapidly and changes can be very different in their nature. Some employer covenant changes may be significant and expected to be permanent, others may not. Similarly, investment values fluctuate constantly with market changes but not all fluctuations will endure or have a lasting adverse impact. Trustees should exercise judgment about the materiality and permanence of changes.
Contingency planning
Trustee risk management plans should identify the potential steps they may take to preserve an appropriately balanced[26] funding strategy and when to take those steps.
Trustees should have a view on the range of likely adverse outcomes that could apply and have an adequate and flexible strategy and governance structure to address these outcomes. This planning should be proportionate[27]. It may be as valuable to the employer as it is for the scheme because potential volatility can be damaging for both. In simple form, it can involve the identification of triggers for provision of information and review and discussion by both trustees and employer of how matters might be addressed.
Where trustees agree with the employer to accept more risk than can be supported by the available employer covenant, contingency plans will need to be more definitive as they can provide additional support for the scheme. The plans should be aimed at preventing risk from escalating to levels which the trustees would not find acceptable. They can also be used in anticipation of an improved position (so that, for example, employer concerns over potential scheme funding surplus can be addressed). Options available include:

Appendix: Corresponding Northern Ireland legislation
Introduction
This code of practice (the DC code) is issued by The Pensions Regulator (the ‘regulator’), the body that regulates occupational and personal pension schemes provided through employers.
The regulator’s statutory objectives[1] are to:
protect the benefits of pension scheme members
reduce the risks of calls on the Pension Protection Fund
promote, and improve understanding of, the good administration of work-based pension schemes
maximise compliance with the duties and safeguards of the Pensions Act 2008.
The regulator has a number of regulatory tools, including issuing codes of practice, to enable it to meet its statutory objectives.
Codes of practice provide practical guidelines on the requirements of pensions legislation. They set out standards of conduct and practice expected of those who must meet these requirements[2].
Status of codes of practice
Codes of practice are not statements of the law and there is no penalty for failing to comply with them. It is not necessary for all the provisions of a code of practice to be followed in every circumstance. Any alternative approach to that appearing in the code of practice will nevertheless need to meet the underlying legal requirements and a penalty may be imposed if these requirements are not met. When determining whether the legal requirements have been met, a court or tribunal must take any relevant provisions of a code of practice into account[3].
If there are grounds to issue an improvement notice, the regulator may issue a notice directing a person to take, or refrain from taking, such steps as are specified in the notice. These directions may be worded by reference to a code of practice issued by the regulator[4].
This code of practice
This DC code is underpinned by a number of defined contribution (DC) quality features that describe those activities, behaviours and control processes that are more likely to deliver good member outcomes. The DC quality features are set in the context of their legal requirements and represent the standards we expect trustees to attain. They will help trustees to demonstrate they are complying with legal requirements.
The practical guidance sections in this DC code are not intended to prescribe the process for every scenario. They do, however, provide principles, examples and benchmarks against which trustees can consider whether or not they are reasonably complying with and have understood their duties and obligations.
If trustees are, for any reason, unable to act in accordance with the procedures set out in this DC code, or an alternative approach that meets the underlying requirements, they should consider their statutory duty under section 70 of the Pensions Act 2004 to assess and if necessary report breaches of the law.
To whom is this code directed?
This DC code applies to trustees of all occupational DC trust-based pension schemes with two or more members (whether active, deferred or pensioner) which offer the following types of benefit:
money purchase benefits, including additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) under occupational defined benefit (DB) trust-based pension schemes or sections and the DC element of hybrid schemes
money purchase benefits with a DB underpin: we would normally expect these benefits to be treated as money purchase benefits throughout their lifetime but with the relevant DB legislation and supporting codes of practice and guidance also applied to the underpin (as trustees must ensure that appropriate funding is in place for the underpin).
This DC code also applies where governance and administration functions described in the DC code applicable to trustees have been delegated to a sub-committee or outsourced.
This DC code does not apply to:
schemes providing DB benefits only or DB benefits in hybrid schemes
work-based personal pensions, stakeholder schemes or other contract-based schemes.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this DC code impacts on these two types of arrangements. These continue as described in existing codes and guidance issued by the regulator.
Terms used in this code
For the purpose of this DC code, reference to ‘trustees’ includes trustee directors of a corporate trustee.
How to use this code
The DC code is structured as a reference document to be used by trustees to inform their actions in five core areas of scheme governance.
While trustees need to be familiar with the DC code as a whole, we suggest they work through each section systematically. For example, trustees could prioritise sections of the DC code and work through the detail on a modular basis.
In certain areas, the practical guidance sections have been drafted to address issues which may be more relevant to particular types of schemes, for example master trusts.
We define a master trust as an occupational trust-based pension scheme established by declaration of trust which is or has been promoted to provide benefits to employers which are not connected and where each employer group is not included in a separate section with its own trustees. For this purpose, employers are connected if they are part of the same group of companies (including partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures).
Other relevant codes of practice
The DC code provides trustees with a central point of reference for areas of governance addressed by the DC quality features. The DC code draws on information already contained in two other codes of practice – Code of practice no. 7: Trustee knowledge and understanding and Code of practice no. 9: Internal controls and builds on the requirements from a DC perspective.
Trustees should also read the following codes of practice in conjunction with this DC code:
Reporting breaches of the law
Trustee knowledge and understanding (TKU)
Internal controls
Reporting late payment of contributions to occupational pension schemes
Member-nominated trustees/member-nominated directors – putting arrangements in place
Early leavers – reasonable periods
Dispute resolution – reasonable periods.
Trustees of schemes which offer hybrid benefits should read this DC code alongside all our codes.
Relationship with the DC regulatory guidance
The DC code and DC regulatory guidance: Governance and administration of occupational defined contribution trust-based pension schemes address the DC quality features that we expect to be present in all occupational DC trust-based schemes that provide money purchase benefits.
The DC code focuses on quality features that are related to the requirements of pensions legislation and the DC regulatory guidance covers those quality features that reflect our view of good practice.
Trustees should read the DC code and DC regulatory guidance in conjunction with each other.

reviewing and updating skills and knowledge.
Understanding trustees' duties
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
understand their duties and be fit and proper to carry them out
ensure that sufficient time and resources are identified and made available for maintaining the ongoing governance of the scheme.
Legal requirements
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes must have knowledge and understanding of:
law relating to pensions and trusts
principles relating to investment matters[5].
In relation to a trustee’s knowledge of pensions and trusts law, trustees must have an appropriate degree of knowledge and understanding to enable them to properly exercise their functions as a trustee[6].
Trustees must be conversant with (ie have a working knowledge of) relevant scheme documents to be able to use them effectively when carrying out their duties. Relevant documents include the scheme rules, the scheme’s statement of investment principles and any other documents which relate to administration of the scheme.
Trustees with any special knowledge or experience, or who act as a trustee in the course of a business or profession, must meet a higher standard of care as set out in the Trustee Act 2000[7]. In relation to investment, all trustees must take advice from professional advisers regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000[8]. They must use special knowledge or experience in a manner that would reasonably be expected of a person acting in the course of that kind of business or profession. When considering the internal controls provisions[9] in the Pensions Act 2004, trustees will have to manage these obligations.
Practical guidance to help trustees[10]
Deciding what level of knowledge is required
Trustees should read their scheme’s rules, deeds of amendment, statement of investment principles, payment schedule, member booklets and other key member communications. They should understand these documents in enough detail to know where to refer to a particular provision in the event an issue arises.
For example, to aid discussions around investment options, trustees should be familiar with the scope of their investment power. They should understand key elements of their statement of investment principles and identify any constraints to investment decision-making.
We expect a trustee’s breadth of knowledge and understanding to be sufficient to allow the trustee to understand fully any advice they are given. We expect trustees to be able to challenge any advice they are given and understand how advice impacts on any decisions for which they are legally responsible.
The level of knowledge and understanding required of trustees will vary according to the role and expertise of the trustee and the type of scheme. For example, we expect a trustee of an occupational DC trust-based pension scheme who is also an investment expert (for instance as a result of their day job) to have a greater level of knowledge than what we would consider appropriate for trustees without this background. However, all trustees should attain appropriate knowledge so that they are able to understand the key areas around investment in some detail.
A professional trustee (ie someone who acts as a trustee in the course of their business or profession and charges for their services) is expected to have a higher level of knowledge than a lay trustee.
What trustees need to know
The benefits that the scheme offers
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes should be familiar with the benefits offered under their scheme. In particular, they should understand what constitutes a money purchase benefit as described in the Pensions Act 2011 and be familiar with exactly where their scheme fits within this. In the case of hybrid schemes, trustees should ensure they understand the differences between the treatment of money purchase benefits and DB benefits, and how money purchase assets are held compared with the DB assets.
Details of the types of benefits offered are usually described in the scheme rules so it is important that trustees understand these. They are also described sometimes in members’ terms of employment. While trustees are not expected to review members’ terms and conditions of employment, they may want the employer(s) to confirm that scheme benefits are consistent with terms of employment.
Trustees should also establish whether the employer(s) intends their scheme to be used as an automatic enrolment scheme.
The scope of trustees’ powers under the rules
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes must understand the extent of key DC powers in their scheme rules[11], which includes the following.
The scope of the trustees’ investment power. Trustees should review this power to understand the extent (if any) to which their power of investment under the rules is limited.
The scope of the trustees’ power to amend their scheme. Trustees should establish who has the ability to amend the scheme rules – is it the trustees, employer, provider (in the case of master trusts) or a joint power? This rule is key as it determines who has the power to change future service benefits, for example where contribution structures are written into the rules.
Who has the power to appoint and remove trustees.
On what basis the trustees can act. For example, whether decisions are made by majority vote or must be unanimous. Specific arrangements for the numbers and identities of trustees signing documents are often made outside the scheme rules, but trustees should establish what these arrangements are and ensure they are clearly documented.
Whether trustee powers to appoint or remove advisers are limited.
Who has the power to authorise bulk transfers in and out of the scheme.
The scope of the power to terminate and wind up the scheme. In particular, trustees should ensure they understand the process involved to ensure the security of members’ benefits on winding up.
Key issues for trustee meetings
Trustees need to make sufficient time to discuss key issues affecting their scheme. The issues that are likely to appear as regular agenda items include the following.
Investment monitoring to address the appropriateness of investment strategies (particularly the default strategy) and fund choices. Trustees should periodically invite managers to attend meetings to discuss reports, evaluate market conditions and consider reasons for short-term fluctuations in performance.
Scheme risks to determine whether the profile of key risks has changed.
Scheme costs and charges to assess costs and charges incurred by the scheme and all scheme members.
Administration to ensure the administration services provided to the scheme are of a good standard. In-house and third-party administrators should be asked to attend trustee meetings and to provide regular (for example quarterly) updates.
Communications to ensure that information sent to members (both active and deferred) is accurate, clear, understandable and engaging.
Legal update to raise awareness of and understand any changes in the law (including legislation, case law and ombudsman determinations) which affect DC provision.
Trustee training to ensure that trustees understand relevant issues where a gap in their knowledge has been identified or as new issues emerge.
Where schemes offer DB and DC benefits, it is important that trustees devote sufficient time to DC matters. It is not appropriate to tag on an important DC-related discussion at the end of a trustee meeting. Trustees should set aside enough time at meetings to address DC issues in detail. However, it may not be appropriate to have regular meetings devoted simply to AVCs where a scheme offers DB or hybrid benefits.
Trustees must keep written records of meetings[12] which show the:
date, time and place of the meeting
names of trustees invited
names of trustees (and others such as scheme advisers) who were at the meeting
names of trustees who were not at the meeting
decisions made
date, time and place of any decisions made at the last meeting, including urgent decisions and the names of trustees who took part.
Newly appointed trustees
Newly appointed individual trustees have a period of six months from the date they are appointed as trustee to complete the required learning[13]. This period is designed to give new trustees time to acquire necessary knowledge and understanding. Newly appointed lay trustees should start immediately to acquire the appropriate knowledge and understanding. This should include familiarising themselves with the scheme’s trust deed, rules and relevant documents.
Even a new trustee is accountable in law and must be equipped to make the decisions with which they might be faced. Therefore, trustees should consider offering pre-appointment training and requiring candidates to attain sufficient levels of knowledge and understanding before appointment. This will give them the necessary skills to undertake their role effectively straight away. Trustees should also consider arranging for experienced trustees to mentor new trustees.
Newly appointed professional trustees or trustee directors have a higher duty of care[14] and should bring their experience and knowledge to the scheme upon appointment. They should have a Pensions Management Institute qualification or equivalent knowledge before they are appointed.
Trustees with a specialist role
Trustees who have a specialist role are expected to acquire a detailed level of knowledge to enable them to undertake their role properly. For example, where investment decisions are delegated to an investment sub-committee, the sub-committee should include members who have detailed investment knowledge.
Trustees must be aware that their individual legal duties to meet the appropriate levels of knowledge and understanding are not waived when functions are delegated to a sub-committee. This remains the case even if the sub-committee has specialised expertise and has been authorised by the main board to carry out the work or make a particular decision on the board’s behalf.
Reviewing and updating skills and knowledge
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
regularly review their skills and competencies to demonstrate they understand their duties and are fit and proper to carry them out
ensure that accountability and delegated responsibilities for all elements of running the scheme are identified, documented and understood by those involved.
Legal requirements
An individual must have an appropriate degree of knowledge and understanding to enable them properly to exercise their function as a trustee[15]. Trustees should keep their knowledge and understanding up to date so that it remains relevant.
Practical guidance to help trustees[16]
Trustees need to ensure that their level of knowledge and understanding remains appropriate throughout their term of office. This includes:
ensuring that training is a regular point of discussion at trustee meetings
reviewing their individual levels of knowledge and understanding at least annually to help identify and address any knowledge gaps
ensuring they are suitably prepared before discussions on upcoming changes affecting the scheme where trustees may have limited experience, for example corporate activities.
Trustees should ensure that, where possible, they plan ahead for training and development requirements in preparation for scheme activities that may require new skill sets.
Training programme
Where an assessment identifies any knowledge gaps or weaknesses which could hinder performance, these should be documented and addressed promptly in a training programme.
Trustees should log all training undertaken. This will help demonstrate how they have mitigated risks associated with knowledge gaps.
The training programme should cover key areas such as:
setting an investment objective and strategy for the scheme’s default strategy
reviewing performance against the scheme’s longer term investment strategy
how to select appropriate fund options for members to choose from
how to monitor adviser and service provider performance
how administration of the scheme is carried out and controlled
the balance of powers between the trustees and the sponsoring employer under the scheme rules
decumulation issues, for example the processes leading up to retirement, flexible retirement and annuity options, understanding issues around open market options and communicating retirement options to members
understanding how certain events such as a merger, closure or full or partial wind-ups will affect the scheme and what needs to be done.
Trustees should make time to attend training courses and undertake independent learning to address knowledge gaps.
Trustee toolkit
We have developed the Trustee toolkit ( trusteetoolkit.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk ), a free online training course that addresses knowledge and understanding required by trustees. Successful completion of the Trustee toolkit can help trustees to evidence that they have the appropriate knowledge and understanding. The Trustee toolkit enables users to print out their general progress through the toolkit as well as a certificate upon successful completion.
Trustees must complete the Trustee toolkit or demonstrate that they otherwise meet the requirement for appropriate knowledge and understanding. This might include a record of other educational qualifications or courses attended but whatever route is chosen the appropriate level of knowledge and understanding must be obtained within six months of being appointed[17].
Fitness and propriety
Trustees need to be fit and proper to carry out their duties[18]. We expect trustees to act honestly and with integrity, competence and capability, and financial soundness. When looking at fitness and propriety we will take a number of issues into account, including:
any attempt to deceive
any misuse of trust funds
any breaches of trust law, particularly if these are significant, persistent, deliberate or contrary to legal advice received
if a trustee’s charges were to constitute a breach of trust or demonstrate a lack of internal controls
if trustees persistently or seriously commit breaches of law (including pensions legislation)
criminal convictions (other than those noted under section 29 of the Pensions Act 1995) so far as these are not spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. These convictions are not limited to those involving dishonesty or deception and could involve convictions for money laundering, violence or substance abuse, for example.
When employers and trustees consider applications for new trustee appointments they should consider, as part of the recruitment process, the fitness and propriety requirements of all candidates. They should also review the fitness and propriety of all appointed trustees on an ongoing basis.

In a quality scheme, trustees will:
establish and maintain adequate internal controls which mitigate significant operational, financial, regulatory and compliance risks
ensure that sufficient time and resources are identified and made available for maintaining the ongoing governance of the scheme.
Legal requirements
Trustees must establish and operate internal controls which adequately ensure that the scheme is administered and managed in accordance with the scheme rules and the requirements of the law[19]. ‘Internal controls’ are defined in the legislation as:
arrangements and procedures to be followed in the administration and management of the scheme
systems and arrangements for monitoring that administration and management
arrangements and procedures to be followed for the safe custody and security of the assets of the scheme.
If trustees persistently fail to put in place adequate internal controls, this may cause an administrative breach, maladministration or, in more extreme cases, result in the reduction or loss of scheme assets.
Where the effect and wider implication of not having in place adequate internal controls are likely to be materially significant, we expect to receive a whistleblowing report that outlines information relating to the breach[20].
Practical guidance to help trustees[21]
Trustees must identify, evaluate and manage the risks that relate to their scheme[22].
Stage 1: Identifying risks
Trustees must identify the risks that are critical to the scheme and which are likely to have a material impact on the scheme’s ability to provide member benefits if they are not managed effectively.
Trustees should consider information drawn from a number of sources to help identify risks present in their scheme. This includes internal audit reports, service contracts, complaints, administration reports and external audit reporting.
Areas of risk that are likely to have a significant impact on an occupational DC trust-based pension scheme include:
fraud (including pension liberation fraud) and the importance of independent oversight
investment
corporate activity relevant to the scheme
retirement and members’ decumulation options.
Once trustees have identified risk areas they should record them in a risk register. Recording risks helps to formalise risk management procedures and provides trustees with a central reference point for future trustee meetings.
Stage 2: Evaluating risks
Not all risks will have the same potential impact or the same likelihood of materialising. Trustees need to look at both these areas and assess which risks the scheme can absorb without the need to take further action, and which risks require adequate internal controls to reduce their incidence and impact.
Trustees must therefore develop a process for evaluating risks and consider the impact that risks may, or will, have on scheme operations and assess the probability of a risk materialising.
The evaluation process must reflect the effectiveness of controls against suitable success criteria. It should consider the impact and likelihood of a risk occurring.
The basis upon which trustees measure the impact of risks may vary. However, the model below describes one simple approach trustees could use to evaluate risks. This measures the likelihood of risks occurring against the impact on the scheme.
In this model the classification of risk – for example red, amber or green – dictates the extent to which trustees need to take mitigating action. It is dependent upon a number of factors, including judgement. A risk categorised as red requires immediate attention as it represents a significant threat to the scheme. Where possible, these risks should be avoided altogether.
This is one approach trustees could use to evaluate risks. There are other risk assessment models which trustees might use that are just as effective.
Whichever model the trustees choose, the evaluation process should help trustees to direct resources to priority areas. It is important that trustees address all risks in a sensible order of priority, starting with those which will have the greatest impact on their scheme.
Stage 3: Managing risk
Simply recording and evaluating risk does not mean that risks are being managed. As part of the management and decision-making process, trustees must ensure that controls are suitably designed and implemented to enable them to take appropriate action. Trustees should consider a number of issues including those in the following table.
How the control is performed and the skills of the person performing the control.
For example, master trusts may have a large number of employers with limited experience of pension scheme administration. Trustees of master trust schemes should ensure that employers receive clear instructions addressing information requirements and support to help manage the risk of transmitting poor quality data.
The level of reliance that can be placed on information technology (IT) solutions if processes are automated.
For example, if administration services are provided using an automated system, external auditors could audit the system on an annual basis on behalf of the trustees and should audit if any issues are identified.
Whether or not a control would stop something from happening or merely detect something that has already happened.
For example, it is not possible to prevent a significant fall in global markets. However, an investment subcommittee should ensure that the main trustee board is informed enough to make a particular decision or recommendation to the main board for quick approval (subject to taking appropriate investment advice).
The frequency and timeliness of a control process.
For example, trustees who find their data is incomplete should undertake data-cleansing or member-tracing exercises and review this on a regular basis (at least annually).
The process or reporting mechanism for flagging errors or control failures.
For example, if trustees identify that member communications are poor quality, they should ensure that they are reviewed and, if necessary, redrafted.
Stage 4: Effective monitoring of risk management controls
Risk management is an ongoing process. Trustees must continually review exposure to new and emerging risks, including significant changes in or affecting the scheme.
Establishing effective internal controls relating to risk management is not a one-off exercise. Trustees should review the risk register in detail at least annually and evaluate their risk assessment arrangements, procedures and systems for material changes. They should record these changes (usually on the risk register itself) with any agreed actions to mitigate the risk.

Setting investment objectives and a default strategy
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
ensure that investment objectives for each investment option are identified and documented in order for them to be regularly monitored
ensure that the number and risk profile of investment options offered reflects the needs of the membership
ensure that a default strategy is provided which is suitable for the needs of the membership
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees of most schemes are responsible for deciding the investment objectives and strategy adopted by the scheme. Only trustees of fully insured schemes do not need to make this decision.
Trustees have a very wide power to invest scheme assets. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the scheme rules, trustees have the same power to make investments of any kind as if they were absolutely entitled to the assets of the scheme[23].
Trustees need to consider the interests of both active and deferred members in a scheme when they make decisions relating to investment options.
Schemes which are not fully insured must also draw up a written statement of investment principles[24]. This statement sets out the trustees’ investment objectives for their scheme and the principles governing how decisions about investments must be made. A statement of investment principles should include the trustees’ policy on the following issues:
setting the investment objective and defining, monitoring and reviewing the default strategy
monitoring and reviewing all investments and investment funds in which the scheme assets are invested
choosing investments and investment funds, and the balance between different kinds of investment and investment funds
risk, including how risk is to be measured and managed, and the expected return on investments
realising investments
the extent to which the trustees take account of social, environmental or ethical considerations when taking investment decisions
using the rights (including voting rights) attached to investments (if the trustees have them).
Trustees must review the statement of investment principles regularly – including whenever there has been a significant change in investment policy[25].
Trustees have a statutory duty to consult with the employer about the scheme’s statement of investment principles[26].
Practical guidance to help trustees[27]
Understanding trustees’ power to invest
Trustees are responsible for investment governance and must be familiar with and understand the scope of the power of investment that is described in their scheme rules[28].
Trustees should use their scheme rules to identify investment powers they may delegate. They should consider whether it is sensible to establish an investment sub-committee. If they do, the trustees should document the delegation of any investment powers in an investment governance plan or as part of the statement of investment principles.
Trustees should be clear that they are responsible for setting and monitoring the default strategy, and for ensuring the long-term suitability of the funds underlying the default strategy. However, in relation to the range of individual funds available for members to choose to invest in, it is the members who set their strategy and the responsibility of the trustees is limited to ensuring that the funds offered perform in line with the manager’s stated objectives.
Setting a default strategy
A default strategy (made up of one or more investment funds) will be selected automatically for a member joining the scheme, unless the member chooses to set their own strategy and chooses funds themselves from those made available by the trustees. Some schemes offer a range of pre-set, risk-rated strategies for members to choose from, although one of these will usually be set as the default strategy for members who fail to make a selection.
Schemes used for automatic enrolment must offer a default strategy[29] as new joiners must not be asked to make a choice or provide information in order to become an active member of a qualifying scheme.
Trustees of all occupational DC trust-based pension schemes have a duty to exercise their powers in the interests of members and beneficiaries[30]. With the exception of AVC investments (where default strategies are rarely offered), and where they have determined this is appropriate, trustees should provide a suitable default strategy even where a scheme is not being used for automatic enrolment.
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has issued guidance[31] on offering a default strategy for DC automatic enrolment pension schemes. This is intended to support existing legislation. Using a high-level, principles-based approach, it covers governance, design, review, monitoring and communication of the default strategy.
Trustees should allow suitable time to design the default strategy and ensure that the membership data on which the default strategy is based is accurate. What is a suitable default strategy will vary from scheme to scheme depending on the needs and demographic profile of the membership.
Trustees should take care to understand and monitor the member-borne costs of the default strategy. For example, trustees should consider an appropriate balance between the frequency of rebalancing, which incurs trading costs, and the efficient delivery of the long-term strategy objective. They should seek to achieve equity between active and deferred member-borne costs and charges and to satisfy themselves that all costs are competitive.
Depending on the type of default strategy selected, execution of some key components may need to be delegated to a third party. For example, in a ‘lifestyle’ strategy, switches between the funds underlying the strategy will usually be carried out mechanically by the scheme administrator. In such circumstances, trustees should satisfy themselves that the third party has the capability and is suitably qualified to execute the trustees’ requirements competently.
Trustees may also delegate some investment decisions in relation to the default strategy to an investment manager. For example, in a target maturity fund, a manager may be given discretion over the timing of changes in the mix of assets within the fund in order to mitigate member-borne risks in the run up to retirement. In such circumstances, trustees need to satisfy themselves that the investment manager is appropriately qualified to manage such a fund.
Trustees should satisfy themselves that their advisers are suitably qualified and capable of giving clear and practical advice. This will enable the trustee board to fully understand the options open to them in setting a default strategy and in delegating functions as necessary to ensure the effectiveness of their strategy. Trustees will need to be clear about what they are delegating and how they will monitor the effectiveness of delegated functions.
Trustees are not responsible for any act or default of any fund manager in the exercise of any relevant delegated discretion about investments as long as they have made sure that they have taken all reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the fund managers:
have the appropriate knowledge and experience to manage the scheme investments
carry out their work competently and in line with the trustees’ policy for choosing investments[32].
Selecting investment funds
Trustees need to select investment funds for the default strategy and, if appropriate for the scheme membership, further investment fund options for members who may wish to set their own strategy.
Trustees should devote sufficient time and resources to the following:
Understand the objective of each investment fund. In particular trustees should understand the:
asset classes being invested in, for example equities and fixed interest
level of risk both in the strategy for each fund and in the underlying investments, for example levels of volatility for each asset class
objective and investment style of the investment manager, for example to replicate or outperform an index and the net of expenses target return, for example to match a cash or inflation benchmark.
Understand the basis upon which the total level of costs and charges is calculated and levied on the fund, for example the extent of annual management charges and other ongoing costs and charges which impact on the value of member accounts.
Ensure the above information is documented so that it can be used to assess the performance of the funds is in line with objectives and continues to remain suitable for members.
Ensure that the fund information provided to members and the employer is accurate and reflects the risk rating and investment objectives of the funds. Whilst trustees will want to ensure that members have the information that they require to make informed decisions, trustees should be careful not to give advice to members.
Ensure that the number and risk profile of investment funds offered as an alternative to the default strategy reflects the needs of the membership. When considering the nature of investment choices available to members, trustees should ensure that investments are suitably labelled so members understand the risk profile of investment options.
As with the design of the default strategy, trustees should retain appropriately qualified advisers who can provide them with professional advice and assistance. Trustees should also ensure that they, or their advisers, obtain sufficient information from their investment managers to be satisfied that they can demonstrate that they have understood all the above matters and have factored them into their solution and their range of funds.
Where a scheme’s rules allow trustees to delegate investment decisions to an investment sub-committee, this can ensure that sufficient time and focus is given to particularly important and complex investment issues. However, all trustees (not just those on the relevant sub-committee) still remain responsible for all decisions made and actions taken by sub-committees.
The investment considerations of a member with a DB pension, supported by AVCs, may be different from a member who is relying solely on a DC pension. Trustees should take a pragmatic approach in these situations.
Security and liquidity of scheme assets
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
predominantly invest in assets admitted to trading on regulated markets. Where unregulated investment options are offered, it must be demonstrable why it was appropriate to offer those investment options
understand the levels of financial protection available to members and carefully consider situations where compensation is not available
understand and put arrangements in place to mitigate the impact to members of business and/or commercial risks
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees must exercise their investment powers in a way which ensures the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole[33]. The regulations cover a range of issues together. The section below focuses on the security and liquidity of the portfolio as a whole.
Trustees must make sure that the scheme assets are invested predominantly in regulated markets[34].
Practical guidance to help trustees[35]
Trustees must give due consideration to asset protection and understand what would happen in the event of a problem[36].
This is a complex area and trustees may need to seek independent advice to determine the extent to which, if at all, situations exist in which any loss caused by misfeasance in relation to the scheme’s assets, or due to insolvency or default, might be covered by a compensation scheme or indemnity insurance. For example, trustees should establish whether contractual arrangements with investment platform providers include an indemnity clause in the event of default.
Trustees should understand the protection relating to assets held overseas either directly or through an investment fund. It may not always be possible to obtain an appropriate and enforceable financial guarantee, particularly in the context of pooled mandates. If no guarantee is available, trustees should consider the extent to which (if any) compensation arrangements and other methods of recourse are available to them if an investment provider defaults and scheme assets are lost or dissipated (other than through exposure to market risk in accordance with the set investment mandates of the fund).
Trustees need to understand the characteristics of complex investment instruments and investment strategies. They should put arrangements in place to ensure that members are suitably safeguarded against loss or misappropriation of assets. They should also consider such things as counterparty risk and the creditworthiness of institutions which hold the scheme’s or a particular investment fund’s cash positions.
Trustees should ensure that the levels and nature of financial protection or compensation available to members is clearly communicated to members and employers. When protection changes, this should also be communicated.
Trustees should establish whether:
the investment funds and products offered to members are regulated, for example by the Financial Conduct Authority or similar regulatory authority in the case of overseas jurisdictions
the investment funds and products qualify for protection and compensation, for example under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
members would qualify for protection and have a claim as a result of the trustee(s) being an eligible claimant.
Trustees should make sure that this information is communicated to members. If trustees decide to offer investments or products which are not regulated by a relevant body they should:
undertake additional due diligence checks on the investment to understand the regulation, compensation arrangements, governance and controls in place, and the risk factors to which members will be exposed
document why they have chosen these investments and why they are suitable for the membership.
Where the trustees consider that adequate protection does not exist they should consider how appropriate it is to hold the asset. If they decide to retain it, trustees should consider what mitigation they can put in place, for example insurance, financial guarantees or changes to contractual terms.
Trustees should consider the liquidity of assets held in the funds underpinning the default strategy and other funds offered to members. When a fund holds illiquid assets, it may be necessary for the fund to restrict dealing frequency. This needs to be taken into account as it may result in delays in investing contributions or rebalancing the default strategy. The out-of-market risk (ie the risk that the member faces of not having market exposure for a period of time) and the risk of being imbalanced to target as the result of such delays needs to be balanced carefully with the potential investment return premium to be gained from holding illiquid assets.

Monitoring and reviewing the default strategy
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
monitor the ongoing suitability of the default strategy for the membership.
Legal requirements
Trustees must regularly monitor and review their scheme’s investment strategy[37].
Practical guidance to help trustees[38]
Trustees should take time to monitor and review the appropriateness of the default strategy.
Certain events may trigger a review of the default strategy such as:
a merger with another organisation which results in a change in the demographics of the scheme membership
a change in ownership or personnel of the investment managers
sustained changes in market conditions.
When reviewing and monitoring the default strategy, trustees should consider its suitability taking into account innovations in DC investment products, changes in regulatory requirements, the demographics of the scheme membership and innovations in the decumulation market. The review should take into account the needs of both active and deferred members. Investment and risk monitoring may help trustees to identify other potential risks. This analysis, coupled with demographic reports, helps trustees to decide whether the risk and maturity profile of the scheme membership is adequately addressed by the default strategy.
Reviewing investment fund performance
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
ensure that arrangements are established to review the ongoing appropriateness of investment options
ensure that the performance of each investment option, including the default strategy, is regularly assessed against stated investment objectives
monitor the ongoing suitability of the default strategy for the membership.
Legal requirements
Trustees must regularly monitor and review the investment options that members can choose from and update their statement of investment principles accordingly[39].
Practical guidance to help trustees[40]
It is important that trustees monitor and review investment performance both for their default strategy’s underlying investment funds and for other investment funds they make available for members who set their own strategy.
Fund performance review triggers
Trustees should build flexibility into the review and assessment arrangements. The size and value of each investment fund should be a factor in considering the nature and frequency of review. Trustees should pay particular and more frequent attention to investment funds that hold a significant proportion of scheme members’ assets, for example the investment funds which underpin the default strategy.
The types of investment funds selected by members may also trigger a review. For example, trustees may decide to select a higher-risk investment fund to review on the basis that it is more volatile, regardless of the fact that it is likely to represent a smaller element of members’ portfolios.
Trustees may consider setting mechanical triggers based upon the performance of investment funds against their benchmarks but these triggers need to be appropriate to the type of fund and its objective. For example, an index-tracking fund may merit triggers which are configured tightly around the index return. However, an actively managed fund holding volatile assets may merit triggers configured more loosely around its long-term performance objective.
In all cases, trustees should set triggers which are appropriate to the long-term nature of pension scheme investments and should not take decisions based upon short-term performance.
Form of review
The review may take different forms, for example based on manager or adviser reports, or involve meetings with the managers or advisers.
When reviewing and monitoring fund performance, trustees should:
assess the performance of each investment fund against stated performance objectives
compare investment returns to industry benchmarks
consider the impact of fees on the investment return as it is the net return which members receive: the level of fees should be checked against appropriate market comparators to ensure they remain competitive
monitor the levels of portfolio turnover and consider whether these are justifiable in light of investment objectives and whether this results in unnecessary costs for members
ensure that controls (including those related to the security, liquidity and safe custody of scheme assets) are in place to alert them to potential risks
regularly assess the effectiveness of the investment decision-making and governance process, make improvements to the process as appropriate and report to interested parties (including members).
Changing investment funds
Where trustees decide to make a change of investment funds or investment manager, they must consider the transition options available and decide which is most suitable for the scheme[41]. They should ensure that there are controls around the transfer process to mitigate out-of-market risks and transition costs. Some common mitigations include:
in specie transfers where the assets are simply reregistered rather than traded
pre-funding which crystallises the cost of transfer and creates certainty
undertaking phased selling to reduce volatility
ensuring that the transfer of investments and cash between the parties is reconciled after transition.
Trustees should consider if any guarantees or other favourable treatment might be lost on transition and if there are any penalties which will be triggered.
Members should be informed in advance of the transfer so they can switch to a different fund if they do not want their investments to be automatically moved to the new fund. Most transitions will also result in a black-out period when members will be unable to view or alter their accounts and this should be communicated to members.
However, member communications should not delay a transfer that needs to happen urgently to protect member investments, for example due to a risk of provider insolvency. In those circumstances, communications should happen as soon as practicable after the transition.
Documenting reviews of investment strategy and fund performance
Trustees should document the arrangements for all reviews of the default strategy and investment fund options. This should include factors considered, decisions made and actions taken. If the trustees conclude that it would be inappropriate to make any changes suggested by the review, they should fully document the reasons for not making those changes.
Investment decision-making and trustee knowledge
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
understand their duties and be fit and proper to carry them out
establish and maintain procedures and controls to ensure the effectiveness and performance of the services offered by scheme advisers and service providers.
Legal requirements
Investment decisions must be taken in the light of appropriate advice from professional advisers such as the scheme’s investment consultants[42].
Practical guidance to help trustees[43]
Trustees’ own knowledge
Trustees must have a good working knowledge of investment matters relating to their scheme[44]. As a starting point, trustees should understand the characteristics of the asset classes, the key differences between those asset classes, their volatility and risks. They should also understand the nature of the investment products through which the scheme gains exposure to assets, for example whether the funds are constituted as life funds or open ended investment companies.
Acting in the best interests of members and beneficiaries
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees must exercise their investment powers in the interests of members and beneficiaries[45]. They also have a more general duty to act in the best interests of beneficiaries.
In acting in the best interests of members and beneficiaries, trustees should take financial interests into account. They must also set out in their statement of investment principles the extent (if at all) to which they have considered issues such as socially responsible investment (for example social, environmental and governance factors) that may affect the long-term performance of investments[46].
If trustees face a potential conflict of interest, they must invest the assets in the sole interests of members and beneficiaries[47].
Where a conflict exists, the trustees should be able to demonstrate that they effectively manage the conflict. They should take appropriate advice and make a reasonable and prudent decision based on the information available at the time.
Practical guidance to help trustees[48]
When considering the suitability of investments, trustees should take into account environmental and social factors which may impact on longer term returns.
When determining whether or not the investment options are socially responsible, trustees may also want to give consideration to ethical issues which may impact on their beneficiaries.
Trustees need to be confident that outsourcing stewardship functions is carried out with the best interests of beneficiaries in mind. While primarily an issue for schemes investing in equity holdings (for example UK listed companies), trustees may want to determine whether a stewardship approach is appropriate for other asset classes.
For example, trustees may want to determine whether and how investment managers are exercising ownership rights. This includes monitoring and engaging with companies on matters such as strategy, performance, risk, capital structure and corporate governance.
More information on quality engagement between institutional investors and investee companies is available in the UK Stewardship Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council[49].

An introduction to trusteeship
If you are a trustee, or considering becoming one, you need to understand what you need to do first, how you can work out if your scheme is being run well, and your role and responsibilities.
Committed and conscientious trustees play an essential role in the proper running of pension schemes. Our aim is to provide you with support and guidance to carry out your role with confidence. Your duties are wide-ranging - from the collecting of contributions to the investment in assets and paying of benefits. The scheme members look to you to make sure that their pension benefits are secure.
Although you have up to six months to acquire the relevant trustee knowledge and understanding, you need to be equipped to be able to make any decisions that may arise in the meantime. This is unless you are a professional trustee or a trustee appointed for your particular expertise, in which case you need to have the relevant knowledge and understanding immediately.

Codes of practice
Codes of practice provide practical guidelines on the requirements of pensions legislation. They set out standards of conduct and practice that you must meet.
You don’t have to follow a code of practice in every circumstance. However, you must ensure that any alternative approach meets the requirements of the legislation underpinning the code of practice.
If we issue an improvement notice we may direct you to take, or refrain from taking, steps based on the provisions of a code of practice.
Some codes apply to all schemes, eg trustee knowledge and understanding , some apply to defined contribution (DC) schemes, eg the DC code , and some apply to defined benefit (DB) schemes, eg funding defined benefits .

Next steps if you have concerns about pension scams
Contact the pension scheme member to establish whether they understand the type of scheme they’ll be transferring to and send them the pension scams scorpion booklet .
Speak to the member at risk – over the phone, via email or letter. It could help you establish answers to more of the questions in the checklist in the pension scams action pack , where you’ve been unable to answer them with the information you have available.
Direct the member to Action Fraud if you think it’s a pension scam, or the Pensions Advisory Service who can help them understand the potential tax consequences of the transfer if any part of the arrangement is deemed as unauthorised.
If the member insists on proceeding with their transfer request, and your concerns remain, then you should alert Action Fraud yourself. There could still be time to protect this member, or others who follow in their footsteps.

DB scheme costs comparison tool
Trustees can use our tool to view highlights from our defined benefit (DB) scheme running costs research report 2014 and compare costs information for schemes of a similar size to their own.
You can use our checklist to help you calculate and compare your DB scheme costs with other schemes.
On this page
Compare your DB scheme costs
Use our DB scheme costs comparison tool
The amount which trustees pay to run their scheme, and the allocation among the various cost types, may vary depending on the design and needs of their scheme and the scheme's complexity, as well as the trustees' and sponsoring employer's own skills.
However, understanding what you are paying, and the range of charges for a cost type, is the first step to considering how to ensure you are getting value for money.
Use the tool below to view highlights from our DB scheme running costs research report and compare costs information for schemes of a similar size to your own.
You may find this helpful to compare what you pay to run your own scheme against the typical cost for schemes in your size band, although cost alone does not indicate whether the scheme is getting value for money.

Corporate changes and transactions
You should understand the impact of corporate changes and transactions on your defined benefit scheme. You should take independent, professional advice where necessary.
Corporate changes and transactions include the employer selling or restructuring their business, transferring the scheme to another sponsor or leaving a multi-employer scheme.
On this page
Key points
Work with the employer to understand the impact of any corporate changes and transactions.
Ask the employer to consider whether it would be appropriate to apply for clearance from us if you believe a corporate transaction is ‘materially detrimental’ to the scheme’s ability to meet its liabilities.
Analyse any proposed abandonment arrangement and reach a decision with other parties as to whether is in the members’ best interests.
If the employer is leaving a multi-employer scheme, work with them to understand which of the options to manage their liability to the scheme under the legislation is most suitable.
Notify us when certain events occur that could lead to a possible call on the Pension Protection Fund.
Corporate transactions
Corporate transactions are employer-related or scheme-related events that may affect the employer’s finances or underlying structure, such as:
selling or restructuring their business
making a return of capital
exiting a multi-employer pension scheme.
You should work with the employer to understand the impact of corporate transactions on your defined benefit (DB) pension scheme.
Back to top
Clearance
If you believe an employer-related or scheme-related event is ‘materially detrimental’ to the scheme’s ability to meet its liabilities, you should ask the employer to consider whether they think that it would be appropriate to apply for clearance from us. For examples of material detriment, read our code-related guidance on the material detriment test .
Clearance is a voluntary process. A clearance statement provides assurance that we won’t use our anti-avoidance powers in relation to the transaction. The statement isn’t our approval of the transaction.
For more information on when it is likely to be appropriate for employers to consider applying for clearance, read our regulatory guidance on clearance .
If your employer decides not to apply for clearance where you believe an event is ‘materially detrimental’ to the scheme’s ability to meet its liabilities, you may wish to raise this with us directly.
Back to top
Abandonment
Abandonment of a pension scheme is where the sponsoring employer cuts its link with the scheme without providing the scheme with sufficient funds or assets to compensate for losing the employer’s ongoing support. This could happen, for instance, when the employer carries out a significant restructuring or transfers their scheme liabilities to another employer.
You need to be able to recognise events that may result in abandonment as they are often not in the members’ best interests.
You should analyse any proposed arrangement and reach a decision with other parties as to whether it is in the members’ best interests. You should also consider whether any alternative options might be available. You should consult with us at an early stage in the process.
Back to top
Leaving multi-employer schemes
There are a number of different ways that employers can manage their obligations if they leave a multi-employer scheme. You should work with the employer to understand which option is most suitable and to ensure that the scheme’s liabilities will continue to be appropriately funded.
Back to top
Notifiable events
There are a number of notifiable events designed to give us early warning of a possible call on the Pension Protection Fund. You must notify us when scheme-related events occur and employers must nominate us when employer-related events occur. For more information, go to our code of practice on notifiable events .

Winding up your DB scheme
If wind up is triggered and not deferred, you must wind up your defined benefit pension scheme efficiently and effectively, and ensure that at least the main tasks are completed within 2 years.
On this page
Key points
Notify us that that your defined benefit (DB) scheme has begun winding up.
Submit a winding-up report if your scheme has not fully wound up 2 years after it was triggered.
Put a project plan in place to help you plan effectively and complete at least the key wind-up activities within 2 years of starting the process.
Triggering wind up for your scheme
You and the employer may decide to wind up the scheme for a number of reasons. For example, if you and the employer are unable to put an adequate funding solution in place you should consider whether you and/or the employer have the power to wind up the scheme and if this is the most appropriate step, or how the scheme’s interests in the employer can otherwise be protected or realised.
You should also be aware when compulsory winding up of the scheme can otherwise be triggered, eg the scheme rules may require the scheme to be wound up if no participating employer remains or we may use our powers to direct you to do so.
Back to top
Notifying the regulator
If your scheme begins to wind up, you must notify us. You can do this using our online service Exchange .
If the scheme has not fully wound up 2 years after wind-up was triggered, you must submit a winding-up report. You can submit the report using Exchange.
Key wind-up activities
The key activities you should complete when winding up your DB scheme are:
calculating whether there is a debt on the employer (under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 (“section 75”)) and serving that debt if so
securing pensioner benefits
identifying the remaining non-pensioners’ share of assets and obtaining terms from an insurer to secure those deferred benefits
issuing option letters to non-pensioners and then details of insured benefits
conducting a final actuarial valuation
obtaining final audited accounts.
You should complete at least the key activities within 2 years of starting the wind-up process. You should create a project plan to help you meet this timeframe.
To avoid unreasonable delays you should adopt a pragmatic and proportionate approach. However, you still need to work in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and rules, your fiduciary duties and other legal requirements.

Section 75 debts
One of the consequences of triggering wind-up is that a section 75 debt may become due from the employer(s) if the scheme has a funding shortfall. The debt is generally equivalent to the amount that it will cost the scheme to buy annuities to secure members’ benefits in full.
After a scheme begins winding up, you need to ensure that section 75 debts are calculated and collected from the employer.

About the Criminal Cases Review Commission
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is an independent public body that was set up in March 1997 by the  Criminal Appeal Act 1995. Our purpose is to review possible miscarriages of justice in the criminal courts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and refer appropriate cases to the appeal courts.
The Commission is based in Birmingham and has about 90 staff, including a core of about 50 caseworkers, supported by administrative staff.
There are eleven Commissioners, appointed in accordance with the Office for the Commissioner for Public Appointments' Code of Practice. They work with the Senior Management Team to ensure the Commission runs efficiently.
We are completely independent and impartial and do not represent the prosecution or the defence.

You should record risks you identify in a risk register.
Evaluating risks
You must develop a process for evaluating risks. This should consider the impact and likelihood of a risk occurring.
Your evaluation process should enable you to direct resources to priority areas. Start with risks that have a high impact and a high likelihood of occurring.
Assess which risks your scheme can absorb without the need to take further action, and which risks you need to manage.
Managing risks
You must have adequate internal controls that are suitably designed and implemented. They need to enable you to take appropriate action.
You should consider certain issues including:
how the control is performed and the skills of the person performing the control
the level of reliance on information technology solutions
whether the control will stop something happening or detect something that has already happened
the frequency and timeliness of a control process
the process for reporting errors or control failures.
Monitoring risk management controls
You must continually review exposure to new and emerging risks. This includes significant changes in or affecting the scheme.
You should review your risk register at least annually and evaluate risk assessment arrangements, procedures and systems for significant changes.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Set up a process that you can use to identify and manage conflicts of interest of trustees, advisers and service providers.
Make sure the process includes a conflicts policy, register of interest, declarations and advance planning.
Setting up a conflicts process
You must have a process that enables you to identify and manage any conflicts of interest for those involved in running your defined contribution (DC) scheme. This includes trustees, advisers and service providers. Your process should include the following controls:
conflicts policy setting out the scheme's approach to dealing with conflicts
register of interests for recording all actual or potential conflicts
declarations when trustees, advisers and service providers are appointed, ongoing declarations by advisers and service providers as soon as they arise, declarations at the start of trustee and sub-committee meetings
advance planning to identify conflicts that may occur in the future.
Back to top
Trustee conflicts of interest
Trustee conflicts of interest can arise in DC schemes. They may arise, for example, when agreeing operational costs such as those relating to administration or communication with employers.
You should be alert to these types of issues and must have processes in place to manage them. This should include ensuring that representation on the trustee board is as balanced as possible.
You or one of your fellow trustees may be an employee of the product provider, particularly if the scheme was set up by an insurer. If a provider-appointed trustee becomes aware of any business-related decisions which have a bearing on the scheme, they should consider the impact this may have on their role as a trustee.
Back to top
Adviser and service provider conflicts of interest
Your advisers and service providers may recommend services or products offered by related parties, for which they may gain financial or non-financial benefit.
Where you believe that any advice or service may be compromised, you should consider further measures to manage the conflict. This may include speaking to other advisers or providers, tendering and comparing products. Document any actions you take.
You should also ensure your advisers and providers have adequate arrangements in place for disclosing and managing conflicts of interest.
If your adviser or service provider is also used by the scheme’s employer, you should consider whether you need to take steps to address potential conflicts.

Key points
Communicate key information to scheme members regularly to keep them informed and to enable them to make decisions.
Provide communications that are accurate, clear, understandable and engaging.
What you need to communicate to members
You must communicate certain information to your defined contribution (DC) scheme members. This includes:
basic information within two months of the member joining, or one month if they have been automatically enrolled – including an explanation of lifestyling where it is offered by the scheme, when it is likely to be adopted, and outlining its advantages and disadvantages
a statutory money purchase illustration showing, for example, the member’s projected pension and an annual benefit statement providing details of contributions credited to the member in the preceding scheme year
certain documents on request, eg trustees annual report, scheme rules, statement of investment principles, and ad hoc benefit statements and transfer values
where the scheme offers lifestyling, an explanation of it and when it is likely to be adopted (or if it has been adopted) five to 15 years before a member retires, and its advantages and disadvantages
information about selecting an annuity from an insurance company of the member’s choice (the open market option) at least four months before their expected retirement date
information when other specific events happen, eg when a member leaves the scheme or the scheme winds up.
You should also communicate information to your scheme members about:
their current investment strategy and why they need to review the suitability of their investment choices
how their level of contributions is a key factor in determining the overall size of their pension fund
costs and charges.
Back to top
Providing good quality communications
The retirement outcome that a member receives is more likely to be improved when they engage on key issues. You should make sure that communications meet the needs of members from when they join the scheme until when they retire.
Many members have little or no interest in their pension until they reach retirement. Therefore, you should ensure that member communications are accurate, clear, understandable and engaging. Focus on providing the right information, at the right time using the right channel.
You should consider how best to use resources such as a scheme website, email, the company intranet, webinars and podcasts, mobile phone applications and text messages.
You should work with the employer. For instance, you may wish to issue joint communications.
Planning
You may wish to document your approach to communications in a plan. This could set out your communication objectives, how you plan to achieve them and who is responsible for the different aspects of communications.
Monitoring
You should review scheme communications regularly, for example once a year, and when legislation changes. Monitor how effective they are in achieving their objectives and take action when they don’t meet their objectives.
You should ensure that member communications is an item in your risk register. Go to risk management .

Key points
A scheme offers value for money where the costs of membership provide good value in relation to the benefits of membership, when compared to other options available in the market.
Consider whether your defined contribution (DC) scheme provides value for money on an ongoing basis and carry out a regular strategic review.
Improve issues within your scope directly with advisers or service providers. Raise concerns outside of your scope with the relevant party.
What is value for money?
A scheme offers value for money where the costs and charges deducted from members provide good value in relation to the benefits and services they receive, when compared to other options available in the market. For instance, if your scheme has higher costs and charges it should offer improved benefits and services.
There is no common definition of what represents value for money. You need to understand what your members will value most when assessing the overall value of the scheme and its individual components.
Costs and charges
Costs and charges have a significant impact on members’ pension savings. You should understand all the costs and charges that apply to the scheme or the investment funds used by the scheme. For more information, go to costs and charges .
Back to top
Assessing value for money
You should keep value for money in mind on an ongoing basis by including it on your scheme’s risk register.
You should also carry out a regular strategic review, eg every three years. You should take a proportionate and cost-effective approach by using ongoing information from service providers and publicly available information.
You should document the results of your assessments as evidence of your activity in this area.
Back to top
Improving value for money
You can often improve issues such as poor administration or investment returns directly with advisers and service providers.
If you have concerns that are not within your scope to resolve, you should raise them with the employer or the party that needs to resolve them.
You or the employer may decide that scheme members will be better served by:
requiring improved service levels
removing unused services
changing provider.
You or the employer may ultimately decide that members are better off in a larger, more competitive scheme so need to wind up the existing scheme. Go to closing your DC scheme .
Back to top
Communicating with members and employers
You should ensure that you clearly disclose to members all costs and charges that are deducted from their pension funds, throughout their membership.
If the employer is considering whether to offer membership of an existing DC trust-based scheme to their staff, you should ensure that clear and accurate information about costs and charges is provided to the employer at point of selection.

Detailed guidance
Key points
Give members the option of selecting a retirement income product (eg an annuity) from an insurance company of their choice.
Set up a process that enables you to communicate information about choosing the most appropriate retirement options.
Support members by providing access to an adviser or annuity broker, or provide information to help members make their own decisions.
Open market option
You must make members aware of the open market option at least four months before their expected retirement date. This means giving members the option of selecting an annuity from an insurance company of their choice and one other than they saved with.
Back to top
Retirement process
Members of your defined contribution (DC) scheme need to choose the right options at retirement to receive the best outcome from their pension savings. However, many members will have low levels of engagement and knowledge about their pension savings.
You should have a retirement process that helps your members to receive a good outcome from their pension savings. Your process should ensure you start communicating with members a number of years before they retire. Make sure you consider:
deferred and active members
members with small and large pots
members with multiple pots
members choosing to retire at different ages, including those retiring in difficult circumstances, such as ill health.
Your process should set out the key activities, timeframes and who is responsible for them. It could include the following stages:
ensure the member understands retirement
ensure the member understands the different ways to take retirement income
ensure the member understands how to buy products
implement member’s decisions
review the retirement process and monitor outcomes.
If a member decides to purchase an annuity on the open market, the rates are generally only held for very short periods so any delays can lead to losses. Make sure your process enables you to act without delay and that you make members aware that they need to act promptly.
Back to top
Types of support
There are two main types of support that you can provide members as they approach retirement. You can appoint a financial adviser or annuity broker to advise members before they make decisions. Alternatively, you and others involved with administration of the scheme can provide information so that members make their own decisions.
You may wish to refer members to information from organisations such as the Money Advice Service to help them make their decisions.
Your pension: it’s time to choose is a useful guide from the Money Advice Service for DC scheme members who are close to retiring and have a pension pot to convert into retirement income.

Quality assurance
Check the quality of the defined contribution scheme you run so that you can demonstrate to employers and scheme members that you’re running a scheme which is more likely to deliver good retirement outcomes.
If you run a multi-employer scheme (known as a ‘master trust’) you should get your scheme independently assured.
Key points
Use our guidance and e-learning resources to help you comply with pensions legislation.
We may take appropriate action (including enforcement if necessary) where pensions legislation is not being complied with.
Report significant breaches of the law to us.
How to comply with pensions legislation
You must comply with pensions legislation affecting you and your defined contribution (DC) scheme.
You can learn about your trustee duties in our Trustee toolkit . You can also find in-depth information about complying with legal requirements and incorporating good practice in the DC code and DC regulatory guidance , and our detailed guidance for trustees .
Key areas to focus on
You should pay particular attention to the following areas:
governance standards, eg internal controls
investment governance and decision-making
Independent trustee register
Closing your DC scheme
If you need to close the defined contribution scheme that you run, you must wind it up efficiently and properly.
On this page
Key points
Notify us that you are winding up your defined contribution (DC) scheme.
Submit a winding-up report if your scheme has not fully wound up two years after wind-up was triggered.
Complete at least the key wind-up activities within two years of starting the process.
Deciding whether to close your scheme
You and/or the employer may decide that you should close the scheme for a number of reasons. For example, you may assess your scheme against our 31 DC quality features and decide that the best course of action is to close it. For more information about using the DC quality features, go to checking you run a quality DC scheme .
If your scheme offers poor value for money, you may also consider closing it. Go to value for money .
You should also be aware when compulsory winding up of the scheme can be triggered, eg the scheme rules may require the scheme to be wound up if no participating employer remains or The Pensions Regulator may direct you to do so.
Back to top
Notifying the regulator
If you decide to wind up your scheme, you must notify The Pensions Regulator. You can notify us using Exchange .
If the scheme has not fully wound up two years after wind-up was triggered, you must submit a winding-up report. You can submit the report using Exchange .

Managing your hybrid scheme
If you run a hybrid scheme you need to manage the defined benefit (DB) elements as if they were a DB scheme and manage the defined contribution (DC) elements as if they were a DC scheme.
Hybrid schemes can be complex. You need to have an in-depth understanding of the scheme structure and the benefits the scheme offers.
On this page
Ensuring robust systems and processes
Key points
You need to have an in-depth understanding of the scheme structure so that you can manage potential risks.
Ensure you have robust systems and processes in place so that you can separately identify and manage the assets attributable to each type of benefit.
Speak with your advisers if you need help understanding the structure and governance of your hybrid scheme, along with the benefits you offer to your members.
Types of hybrid scheme
Hybrid schemes can be complex. They include a combination of DB and DC benefits. Examples of hybrid schemes include:
separate DB and DC sections under one trust
DB scheme with a DC underpin, eg a scheme that will pay a member the better of their DB or DC benefit
DC scheme with a contracted out element on a DB basis
DB schemes with a DC top-up.
Back to top
Potential risks to members
To manage a hybrid scheme you need to have an in-depth understanding of the scheme structure and the benefits the scheme offers.
If you do not understand and manage the scheme appropriately, members will face a number of potential risks:
lack of governance
unclear and incorrect member communication
incorrect benefits and funding levels
inappropriate investment strategies
Back to top
Checking the status of money purchase benefits
The statutory definition of money purchase benefits changed with effect from 24 July 2014. Your scheme may be affected by this change if it offers benefits that have the potential to develop a funding deficit, ie non-money purchase benefits. You should review the trust deed and rules to check whether your scheme, as a result of the benefits it may offer to members, is affected by the changes. Take legal advice where necessary, especially if there is any doubt over the nature of benefits offered by your scheme.
For more information, see our statement on changes to the definition of a money purchase benefit:
Statement Changes to the definition of money purchase benefits (PDF, 69kb, 5 pages)
Published: July 2014
Back to top
Ensuring robust systems and processes
You need to exercise good governance over your scheme by having robust systems and processes in place. This will ensure you can separately identify the assets attributable to each type of benefit.
There are ten key actions you should carry out.
Ensure you understand the different members’ benefit entitlements. This should also include understanding the level of protection offered to each type of scheme member.
Review your governance arrangements over the different benefit elements to ensure that they are sufficiently rigorous. Ensure adequate time is spent on DC-specific matters, including assessing the need for a trustee committee to address DC matters.
Check the robustness and adequacy of your scheme’s internal controls over the different benefit types. This should include regular monitoring of administrative processes and management information. The controls in a hybrid scheme should be sufficient to address the individual DC members’ risks, eg regular reconciliation of assets and cash flows at DC member level.
Ensure the assets for DB and DC elements are clearly identifiable and, if possible, held separately. Check that scheme accounts separately show assets and liabilities allocated to individual members and those which are not.
Understand the safeguards available for the different assets against losses arising from operational, fraud and insolvency failures and how tracing rules would apply for mixing DB and DC assets.
Assess your investment advisers’ and third-party administrators’ skills on DB and DC benefits separately, recognising that different skill sets are required for each benefit element.
Check that our Exchange database contains the correct information to calculate the Pension Protection Fund levy – check with your scheme actuary and advisers, if necessary.
When winding up your scheme ensure you understand the process, how you may need to treat members’ different entitlements and how this interacts with your scheme rules.
Work with your employee benefit consultants to clarify scheme design structures. Check with them that the scheme documentation and communications accurately and coherently explain the scheme design and benefits to members.
Ask your auditors to report on their testing of DB and DC entitlements and the separation of assets between DB and DC benefits.
In general, you must manage the DB elements of your hybrid scheme as if they were a DB scheme and manage the DC elements as if they were a DC scheme. See our sections on managing your DB scheme and managing your DC scheme .
If you’re unsure what actions are appropriate to your hybrid scheme, you should speak with your advisers to gain assurance that you understand the structure and governance of your hybrid scheme, along with the benefits you offer to your members.

Automatic enrolment and the role of trustees
The introduction of automatic enrolment means that all UK employers will have to provide their workers with access to a pension scheme.
Millions of workers have already been automatically enrolled into pension schemes, and while these new duties apply to employers, trustees have an important role to play.
A downloadable version of the information on this web page about automatic enrolment and the role of trustees.

Fine tuning
Your role
As the trustee of a pension scheme, you might find that you are the first point of contact for employers. If this happens, you should be able to provide the right information to employers about automatic enrolment, for example whether your scheme is suitable to be used, and what impact automatic enrolment might have on your scheme.
If an employer chooses to use your scheme there may be other tasks that they ask the trustees to undertake on their behalf, such as communicating with members or completing a declaration of compliance (registration) with the regulator to confirm that the employer has complied with the new duties.
Back to top
The impact on your scheme
While an employer may approach your scheme, we think many of them will choose a group personal pension or a master trust for automatic enrolment. Usually run by large specialist pension providers, these schemes are generally designed to be used by large numbers of different employers. However, if an employer does explore the possibility of using your scheme for automatic enrolment, it’s important that you are able to quickly assess whether this is possible and feasible.
You also need to consider the impact on the scheme of potential new members and any additional resources needed to accommodate them. This will include the impact on the quality of service that existing members receive. You should also, in conjunction with the employer, consider who will pay for any additional costs associated with an increase in membership.
Trustees should consider whether their scheme is in a position to accommodate the potentially rapid and significant increase in administration and governance requirements that may occur if their scheme is used to automatically enrol workers.
If it is concluded that your scheme is not in a position to be used for automatic enrolment you can direct the employer to our guide to selecting a scheme below.
Back to top
Check whether your scheme can be used for automatic enrolment
An employer can only elect to use a scheme for automatic enrolment if it meets certain legal criteria. These include that the scheme does not require the worker's consent to join, that it allows workers to join from their first day of employment, and that it is tax registered in the UK.
If you run a defined contribution (DC) scheme, then you can use our qualifying scheme tool below to assess whether your scheme can be used.
Interactive tool DC qualifying schemes tool
The tool will help you assess whether your DC scheme is a qualifying scheme and explains the additional criteria that the scheme will need to meet in order to be used for automatic enrolment.
If you run a defined benefit (DB) scheme, then we have guidance that can help you with this assessment below.
Guidance 4: Pension schemes (PDF, 341kb, 38 pages)
See our detailed guidance to check whether a DB scheme qualifies for automatic enrolment.
If your scheme does not qualify, you can suggest that the employer uses our employer's guide to selecting a good quality scheme for automatic enrolment (see above) to help them select a different scheme.
Alternatively, the employer may ask you to change the scheme rules so that your existing scheme can be used. If changes are proposed then you will need to consider, and advise the employer, whether existing scheme members need to be consulted about the proposed change.
As well as ensuring that the scheme they select qualifies for automatic enrolment use, employers should choose a good quality pension scheme that is well run, offers value for money and protects workers’ retirement savings.
We have provided guidance for employers to help them assess whether a DC scheme is of good quality. This includes whether the set up of the scheme is straightforward, the investment options on offer, how well investments are managed, whether costs and charges provide value for money, the qualifications of those responsible for running the scheme and the quality of communications provided to members.
Back to top
Fine tuning
Whether or not your scheme is going to be used to meet the employer duties, it’s important that you make sure that it is performing well and in the interests of its members. In particular, DC scheme trustees should take this opportunity to ensure that their scheme is well run, offers value for money and protects workers’ retirement savings.
We have published the DC code of practice and accompanying DC regulatory guidance on the governance and administration of DC schemes. You can use our introduction to the DC code and DC regulatory guidance to review the quality features we expect to be present in your scheme. These features focus on how trustees need to understand their scheme, risk management, investments, governance, administration and member communications.

HM Courts & Tribunals Service was created on 1 April 2011. It brings together HM Courts Service & Tribunals Service into one integrated agency providing support for the administration of justice in courts and tribunals.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service is an agency of the Ministry of Justice. It uniquely operates as a partnership between the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals as set out in our Framework Document.
The agency is responsible for the administration of the criminal, civil and family courts and tribunals in England and Wales and non-devolved tribunals in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It provides for a fair, efficient and effective justice system delivered by an independent judiciary.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service aims to ensure that all citizens receive timely access to justice according to their different needs, whether as victims or witnesses of crime, defendants accused of crimes, consumers in debt, children at risk of harm, businesses involved in commercial disputes or as individuals asserting their employment rights or challenging the decisions of government bodies.
From April 2011 the agency employs 21,000 staff operating from around 650 locations. It has a gross annual budget of around 1.7bn, approximately 585m of which is recovered in fees and income from service users. It handles over 2 million criminal cases, 1.8 million civil claims, more than 150,000 family law disputes and almost 800,000 tribunal cases annually.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service works with a range of Government departments and justice agencies to ensure access to justice is provided in the most timely and effective way possible.
The agency's work is overseen by a Board headed by an independent Chair working with non-executive, executive and judicial members. The Board ensures that the agency delivers the aims and objectives set by the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals.

Pay the levy by direct debit
Direct debit - the easy way to pay your scheme levy. It's a safe and secure way to make payments, it's free to set up and can save you time and effort (no need to post a cheque).
Set up a direct debit today in four easy steps:
Log on to Exchange .
Navigate to the 'My schemes' page and select from your list of associated schemes (if you've not yet associated to your scheme, any existing associated Exchange user is able to provide you access to your scheme).
Choose 'Maintain / View scheme levy' from the 'Scheme options' page.
Select 'Set up a direct debit for levy payments'.
Understanding your levy invoice
The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions sets the rate of the general levy each year.
The general levy is based on the total number of members in the scheme at the end of the scheme year before last.
You can update your scheme's membership using scheme maintenance in Exchange .
Here are some examples:
Levy payable on 1 April 2014 would be based on total scheme membership taken as at the scheme year end prior to 1 April 2013 - if the scheme year end is 5 April, membership will be taken as at 5 April 2012.
ABC Pension scheme is a defined contribution (money purchase) pension scheme and is eligible for the 2014 levy invoice. The membership figure of 200 was taken as at 5 April 2012. The general levy rate for 100 - 999 members is £2.08 per member, therefore the amount payable for the general levy is £2.08 x 200 = £416.
The amount to be paid depends on the band which the scheme falls into and may be subject to a minimum amount per band.

Information you need to submit
When you submit a recovery plan using Exchange you need to select either the 'new' or 'amend' option. You should only select 'amend' if you want to amend an existing recovery plan that you have previously sent us through Exchange. All 'amend' submissions must have the same valuation date as the recovery plan that the submission is amending.
You will also be asked to:
confirm the identity of the scheme's actuary and provide their contact details
select a trustee to be the contact point for the recovery plan and ensure that they have registered their current email address and telephone number on Exchange
fill out a breakdown of annual recovery plan contributions up to a maximum of 20 years
confirm whether independent advice has been obtained on the employer covenant for the valuation and recovery plan being submitted – this is a ‘yes / no’ question and you don't need to provide a copy of covenant advice when making your online submission (though we may request a copy later)
attach the scheme’s statement of funding principles as a PDF
attach the scheme’s statement of investment principles as a PDF – if you’re exempt from producing a statement of investment principles you don’t need to submit this document.
If you provide this information, it will help prevent the need for us to ask you for additional information.
Providing us with the additional contact details will also allow us, in the majority of cases, to communicate the outcome of our review of the recovery plan by email to the relevant trustee and the scheme actuary. We send all emails securely and details of the outcome of the review are in an attached document. You will need a password to access the document which we send in a separate email.

Consumer Prices Index
The Government introduced new rules to move to using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Prices Index (RPI) to calculate inflation-linked statutory revaluation and pension increases. However, it also confirmed that it won’t introduce a statutory power to amend scheme rules to allow schemes to use CPI as the basis for revaluation and indexation of members’ benefits in cases where the scheme rules do not already contain such a power.
You may want to take legal advice if you are uncertain how the changes affect your scheme. We can’t advise on the effect of the changes on any particular scheme, as this depends on the wording of the scheme rules.
As part of the scheme funding regime and associated processes, you must provide us with a summary of the actuarial valuation, which amongst other things includes the principal assumptions on which the calculation of the technical provisions have been based. You also need to provide details of the CPI assumption.
What do I do if I'm not sure of the benefit type of the scheme?
The benefit type of your scheme will be one of the following three types:
defined benefit (DB) - offers a pension based on how much a member earns and how long they are an employed member of the pension scheme
defined contribution (DC) - offers a pension based on value of the fund that has accrued as a result of contributions that have been made together with the investment returns
hybrid scheme - a combination of DC and DB.
Please refer to your scheme trust deed and rules which should indicate the benefit structure of your scheme.
What do we mean by active, deferred and pensioner members?
Broadly active, deferred and pensioner members are:
Active members: members of an occupational pension scheme who are at present accruing benefits under that scheme in respect of current service.
Deferred members: members of an occupational scheme who have accrued benefits under that scheme relating to their past service and who are no longer active members but have not yet retired. These members may continue to work for the employer, or have left the employment of the employer associated with the scheme. This category of membership will remain until every individual in that category either transfers their pension entitlement to an alternative pension arrangement or starts to take their pension entitlement as a retirement pension.
Pensioner members: members who are entitled to payment of a retirement benefit that is payable by the trustees or managers of the pension scheme in respect of their pensionable service. This will include individual annuities in payment where the annuity is written in the name of the trustees or managers of the scheme. A member who has taken their pension entitlement by purchasing an annuity in their own name is not classed a pensioner member.
Is it still necessary to complete a scheme return if my scheme is winding up?
Yes. You're still legally required to complete a scheme return even if your scheme is in the process of winding up.
However, you’re not expected to complete a scheme return if your scheme has fully wound up. You can notify us if your scheme has been wound up by completing the initial questions in Exchange.
If your scheme is winding up and you're experiencing problems with completing your scheme return contact us .
Further scheme return guidance
What do I do if I receive an overdue notice but not the initial scheme return notice?
We issue a scheme return notice to the contact listed in our records at the time it's issued. If you’ve updated your scheme return contact since the original notice was issued an overdue notice is sent to the new contact.
The overdue notice has all the information you need to login to Exchange to complete the scheme return. You don’t need to have the original scheme return notice to complete your scheme return.
What do I do if I receive a scheme return notice for a scheme I don't recognise?
If you receive a scheme return notice for a scheme you don't recognise contact us .
What should I do if I complete the scheme return for the wrong scheme?
Log back into Exchange and amend the information. If you're unable to do this please contact us .
Do I need to complete a return for The Pensions Regulator if I complete a return for HMRC?
Yes. The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) scheme return is entirely separate to The Pensions Regulator's scheme return. We collect data for different purposes to HMRC.
After you complete your scheme return
What happens after I submit the scheme return?
Once you have submitted your scheme return you will receive a confirmation email (the email is sent to the Exchange user account from which the scheme return was submitted).
Trustees (and managers) are legally required to notify us of any changes to their registrable information. This includes changes to the following details:
name and / or address of the scheme
employer or trustee
scheme's status
number of scheme members.
You can access your scheme information via Exchange at any time to update any information that has changed. Keeping your scheme information up to date will also help you complete your scheme return more quickly and efficiently.
Can I change any information on the scheme return after I submit it?
Trustees (and managers) are legally required to notify us of any changes to their registrable information. This includes changes to the following details:
name and / or address of the scheme
employer or trustee
scheme's status
number of scheme members.
You can access your scheme information via Exchange at any time to update information that has changed. Keeping your scheme information up to date will also help you complete your scheme return more quickly and efficiently.
In the past you may have used form PR10 to let us know of any changes. However, you can now access this online scheme maintenance system at any time, enabling you to update your scheme information with changes as and when they happen. You no longer need to complete a form PR10.
Joining the trustee register
Independent trustee register
The Pensions Regulator is required by statute to compile and maintain a register of trustees who fulfil certain legislative conditions. The regulator meets this requirement through the creation and maintenance of its trustee register.
Joining the trustee register
About the trustee register
Since 2005, the regulator has accepted applications to be on the trustee register from sole trader trustees and trustee organisations (eg partnerships and companies).
The regulator uses the trustee register to appoint independent trustees to schemes under sections 22 and 23 of the Pensions Act 1995. These appointments are usually made, on expedient or protective grounds, to ensure that the scheme is properly administered and the members protected when its employer is insolvent. In addition, although it is not required to do so, the regulator will usually consider appointing a trustee from the trustee register when making appointments under section 7 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Trustees are not required to be on the trustee register; it is a voluntary decision. If a trustee is on the trustee register, this is not a guarantee that it will receive appointments from the regulator. Before making any appointment the regulator considers the unique circumstances and needs of the scheme before selecting the appropriate trustee candidate for appointment.
Acceptance of a trustee on to the trustee register does not represent an endorsement or approval by the regulator of the services provided by that trustee.
The trustee register is available for inspection at the regulator's offices during normal working hours. If you would like a copy of the trustee register sent to you, please supply your name and address using the contact details below.
Contact details
Applications
Current position
The regulator has devised new criteria which we will be applying when assessing whether the conditions for joining and remaining on the trustee register have been met.
Back to top
Conditions for joining
There are a number of legislative conditions which an applicant must fulfil before admission on to the Independent Trustee Register. The applicant must also continue to meet these conditions to remain on the register. The conditions fall into two categories:
fact-based (ie the conditions are met or not); and
judgement-based (ie in the light of the regulator’s assessment, whether the applicant meets - and continues to meet - the criteria).
The fact-based conditions
The applicant must not be the subject of a prohibition order or suspension order, or disqualified from being a trustee of a trust scheme on any of the prescribed grounds.
Where the applicant is not an individual, every officer and every key person must satisfy certain conditions.
The applicant must have premises in the United Kingdom from which it conducts its trustee business and must disclose the address of those premises to the regulator (the regulator will expect those applicants with presences in other jurisdictions to provide an explanation of how they will safeguard the assets of UK schemes).
The applicant must agree:
to have costs and fees scrutinised by an independent adjudicator and be bound by that adjudicator as to fees and costs;
to the regulator disclosing his name, business address and the specialist areas of trustee work on a version of the trustee register, which is publicly available;
to comply with the regulator’s reasonable requests to provide information; and
to inform the regulator as soon as is reasonably practicable if they become disqualified.
The judgement-based conditions
The regulator must be satisfied that the applicant has, and continues to have, 'sufficient relevant experience' of occupational pension schemes;
The regulator must be satisfied that the applicant is, and continues to be, a 'fit and proper’ person to act as a trustee of an occupational pension scheme;
The regulator must be satisfied that the applicant operates, and continues to operate, 'sound administrative and accounting procedures’; and
The regulator must be satisfied that the applicant has, and continues to have, 'adequate indemnity insurance’ cover.
All applicants must meet each of the fact-based and judgement-based conditions. In addition, where the applicant is a company, partnership or limited liability partnership, some of its main individuals also must meet some of the fact-based and judgement-based conditions.
The regulator's criteria for the judgement-based conditions
Condition
The regulator's criteria
Sufficient relevant experience
Both individuals and Key Persons should have had at least five years of regular or continuous experience as a trustee of occupational pension schemes up to the point of the application.
Non-individual applicants should have had at least three years of regular or continuous experience as a trustee of occupational pension schemes up to the point of the application.
Compliance will be checked on an annual basis.
Fit and proper
The regulator will seek to be satisfied that the applicant has the qualities of fitness and propriety to be a trustee.
All individual applicants, all Key Persons and Officers will need to demonstrate they have a minimum level of understanding of the nature of trusteeship (eg by completing the regulator’s Trustee toolkit) as part of the regulator’s assessment of whether these individuals have met this test.
Compliance will be checked on an annual basis (or whenever any changes are notified to the regulator by the applicant).
Sound administrative and accounting procedures
The regulator has adopted an audit and assurance framework (developed with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales). The regulator requires an unqualified independent assurance report from a reporting accountant submitted by the applicant, upon application and on an annual basis.
The regulator uses this assurance report to help determine whether the legal requirement to have ‘sound administrative and accounting procedures’ has been met.
For more information go to assurance reporting framework .
Adequate indemnity insurance cover
The applicant will need to provide their insurance policy/certification of insurance confirming:
Professional indemnity insurance cover of (in respect of all of its occupational pension trustee work):
at least £2 million for a single claim with at least two reinstatements (ie three claims as a minimum); or
at least £6 million in aggregate annually.
That the policy is solely in the applicant’s name or the applicant is a named insured on a group policy (if any).
That the cover is provided by an independent third-party insurer (ie not a captive insurer).
The applicant must have sufficient resources in its business to cover its policy excess.
Compliance will be checked on an annual basis (or whenever there are any changes (which must be notified to the regulator by the applicant).
Applications
It's important that you read these notes carefully before completing the application forms.
The purpose of the application process is to enable us to obtain information and assurances from the applicant in order that we can assess whether the applicant satisfies the judgement-based and fact-based conditions. This assessment will take place for the purpose of registering the applicant on to the register and, if registration is successful, further assessments will take place on an annual basis in order for us to assess if the applicant continues to satisfy the conditions.
Although requests for information in the forms are split into sections relating to each of the conditions, the information provided may be relevant to the regulator's assessment of the other conditions and may be used accordingly.
We may wish to seek further information from the applicant following our review of the application forms. We may also wish to arrange a meeting with the applicant, either at its premises or at the regulator's offices.
Corporate applications
Corporate (ie Partnership/LLP/Company) applicants need to complete form COR1 (Corporate application form) and form COR2 (Key Person and Officer form) and form COR3 (Corporate experience form). In addition, each Key Person and each Officer from a corporate applicant needs to complete form COR4 (Key Person and Officer Fit and Proper form).

Pension scams
Pension scams are on the increase in the UK. Check the facts before you make an irreversible decision. A lifetime's savings can be lost in a moment.
What's a pension scam?
Pension scams are enticing savers by claiming to help them access their pension before age 55 or that people can already take more than 25% of their pension as cash. For most people the offers will be bogus and victims will lose most, if not all, of their savings.
Only in rare cases – like terminal illness – can pension scheme members take their pension before age 55. It remains the law that pension scheme members can only take up to 25% of their pension savings as a cash lump sum. Although this may change in the future it's important that members aren't fooled into thinking that is the law today.
Pension scheme members who agree to transfer may lose all their savings and may still be subject to tax charges of over half their transfer value for taking an 'unauthorised payment'.

Automatic enrolment and the role of trustees
The introduction of automatic enrolment means that all UK employers will have to provide their workers with access to a pension scheme.
Millions of workers have already been automatically enrolled into pension schemes, and while these new duties apply to employers, trustees have an important role to play.
A downloadable version of the information on this web page about automatic enrolment and the role of trustees.
On this page
Fine tuning
Your role
As the trustee of a pension scheme, you might find that you are the first point of contact for employers. If this happens, you should be able to provide the right information to employers about automatic enrolment, for example whether your scheme is suitable to be used, and what impact automatic enrolment might have on your scheme.
If an employer chooses to use your scheme there may be other tasks that they ask the trustees to undertake on their behalf, such as communicating with members or completing a declaration of compliance (registration) with the regulator to confirm that the employer has complied with the new duties.
Back to top
The impact on your scheme
While an employer may approach your scheme, we think many of them will choose a group personal pension or a master trust for automatic enrolment. Usually run by large specialist pension providers, these schemes are generally designed to be used by large numbers of different employers. However, if an employer does explore the possibility of using your scheme for automatic enrolment, it’s important that you are able to quickly assess whether this is possible and feasible.
You also need to consider the impact on the scheme of potential new members and any additional resources needed to accommodate them. This will include the impact on the quality of service that existing members receive. You should also, in conjunction with the employer, consider who will pay for any additional costs associated with an increase in membership.
Trustees should consider whether their scheme is in a position to accommodate the potentially rapid and significant increase in administration and governance requirements that may occur if their scheme is used to automatically enrol workers.
If it is concluded that your scheme is not in a position to be used for automatic enrolment you can direct the employer to our guide to selecting a scheme below.
Back to top
Check whether your scheme can be used for automatic enrolment
An employer can only elect to use a scheme for automatic enrolment if it meets certain legal criteria. These include that the scheme does not require the worker's consent to join, that it allows workers to join from their first day of employment, and that it is tax registered in the UK.
If you run a defined contribution (DC) scheme, then you can use our qualifying scheme tool below to assess whether your scheme can be used.
Interactive tool DC qualifying schemes tool
The tool will help you assess whether your DC scheme is a qualifying scheme and explains the additional criteria that the scheme will need to meet in order to be used for automatic enrolment.
If you run a defined benefit (DB) scheme, then we have guidance that can help you with this assessment below.
Guidance 4: Pension schemes (PDF, 341kb, 38 pages)
See our detailed guidance to check whether a DB scheme qualifies for automatic enrolment.
If your scheme does not qualify, you can suggest that the employer uses our employer's guide to selecting a good quality scheme for automatic enrolment (see above) to help them select a different scheme.
Alternatively, the employer may ask you to change the scheme rules so that your existing scheme can be used. If changes are proposed then you will need to consider, and advise the employer, whether existing scheme members need to be consulted about the proposed change.
As well as ensuring that the scheme they select qualifies for automatic enrolment use, employers should choose a good quality pension scheme that is well run, offers value for money and protects workers’ retirement savings.
We have provided guidance for employers to help them assess whether a DC scheme is of good quality. This includes whether the set up of the scheme is straightforward, the investment options on offer, how well investments are managed, whether costs and charges provide value for money, the qualifications of those responsible for running the scheme and the quality of communications provided to members.
Back to top
Fine tuning
Whether or not your scheme is going to be used to meet the employer duties, it’s important that you make sure that it is performing well and in the interests of its members. In particular, DC scheme trustees should take this opportunity to ensure that their scheme is well run, offers value for money and protects workers’ retirement savings.
We have published the DC code of practice and accompanying DC regulatory guidance on the governance and administration of DC schemes. You can use our introduction to the DC code and DC regulatory guidance to review the quality features we expect to be present in your scheme. These features focus on how trustees need to understand their scheme, risk management, investments, governance, administration and member communications.

Guide for software developers
Guidance for software developers showing how to update their products to support automatic enrolment.
From October 2012, employers have new legal duties to automatically enrol certain members of staff into a pension scheme and make contributions towards it. It's important that you support your employer clients in complying with their new duties.
This guidance is a comprehensive guide to the key concepts in automatic enrolment included in the ‘core’ payroll routines and wider routines supporting the end to end duties. It describes the employer duties using a technical notation and may not be suitable for a more general readership.
The guidance for software developers is of particular relevance to developers with employer customers who have fewer than 50 persons in their PAYE scheme. This is because with the staggered introduction of the new duties, employers with fewer than 50 persons in their PAYE scheme, will become subject to the new duties during the 2015-2016 financial year.
Guides
A detailed guide to automatic enrolment for software developers (PDF, 3412kb, 285 pages)
Updated April 2014: we've updated this guide to include the 2014/15 automatic earnings thresholds which come into force on 6 April 2014. This guidance is aimed at software developers involved with payroll applications and wider business applications and with employer customers with fewer than 50 persons in their PAYE scheme. Annex C contains a list of the changes since November 2013.
A quick guide to recent changes to automatic enrolment regulations (PDF, 56kb, 7 pages)
Only relevant to software developers who have already developed systems to support automatic enrolment (typically with employer customers with more than 50 persons in their PAYE scheme), this note summarises the recent technical changes made to the automatic enrolment legislation along with a note on the changes we have made to a detailed guide to automatic enrolment for software developers.
Test data companion (PDF, 717kb, 270 pages)
Updated April 2014: designed to be used in conjunction with a detailed guide to automatic enrolment for software developers, the test data companion provides a number of fictitious test scenarios on the new duties. The test data companion has been updated to include test scenarios where the definition of a pay reference period is aligned to tax weeks or months and cyclical automatic re-enrolment.

Sometimes we issue guidance to accompany a code of practice if it would help to:
explain our approach further; or
include information which may need to be amended or extended from time to time (it's quicker to amend our guidance than it is a code of practice).
For example, the guidance issued with the code of practice dealing with reporting breaches of the law gives examples of different situations to illustrate our 'traffic light' approach. It also includes a 'decision tree' to help readers who think they may have to report to us decide whether they actually need to.

Executive summary
Introduction
This year's statistics release is in a different format to previous versions. In July 2011 and December 2011 the regulator released a single document (PDF format) containing the report and data tables. This year we have taken a different approach, releasing the figures in an excel format making the data more accessible for end users to use as they want.
Since the beginning of the scheme specific funding regime one cycle of scheme valuations has been completed and at the time of writing more than half of PPF[1] -eligible Defined Benefit / Hybrid schemes will have completed their second-cycle valuations.
This June 2012 statistical release follows the December 2010 report on the technical assumptions underpinning recovery plans and the June 2011 report on funding and other forms of scheme security. Like the last two reports, which were based on tranche 4 valuations, the current release reflects the evolution of funding positions from the first to second funding cycle and the key technical assumptions that underpin the trends.
The update is based on 'tranche 5'; that is, recovery plans with effective valuation dates falling on and between 22 September 2009 and 21 September 2010. Due dates for completion of tranche 5 recovery plans fell between December 2010 and December 2011. By 31 January 2012, the regulator had received 1733 plans with tranche 5 valuation dates. The plans in this dataset comprise less than a third of schemes in the PPF-eligible universe as some schemes with tranche 5 valuation dates will be in surplus. 78% of the tranche 5 schemes in this dataset submitted recovery plans in tranche 2. Similarly, tranche 8 (cycle 3) recovery plans submitted in 2013-2014, are expected to largely comprise of tranche 5 plans.
The recovery plan features and assumptions in this release are as at receipt; prior to the regulator's review process and any engagement with scheme trustees arising from reviews. This information presented may be of particular interest to trustees, scheme advisers, and others in the pension industry.
A fuller commentary on the tranche 5 statistics is to follow.
Scheme demographics
Approximately 5 in 6 tranche 5 schemes are closed to new entrants. More than half of tranche 5 schemes have technical provisions ranging between £5m and £99m, while approximately 2 in every 3 schemes have memberships below 500 members.
Scheme security and contingent assets
Contingent assets continue to be a key form of scheme security. A total of 358 (21%) of tranche 5 schemes reported having some form of contingent asset. The majority of the assets (265) are recognised by the PPF in respect of the levy calculation while the remaining 93 assets are not.  The majority of schemes reporting PPF recognised contingent assets (90%) hold 'Type A' assets (guarantees provided by the parent/group companies to fund the scheme, most commonly guarantees to cover a pre-arranged percentage of liabilities).
Funding
The average (unweighted) funded status of tranche 5 schemes on the technical provisions, s179, and buyout bases is 78.8%, 92.9%, and 57.8% respectively. Technical provisions as a proportion of s179 liabilities was on average (unweighted) 112.5%, while the proportion of technical provisions to liabilities on a buyout basis was on average (unweighted), 73.2%.
Among the 1355 schemes that submitted recovery plans in both tranches 2 and tranche 5, the average level of technical provisions has increased by 15.7%, while the average value of assets has increased by 6.8%.
Triggers
Triggering in tranche 5 plans compared to tranche 4 plans reflect the slightly improved, though still-depressed, economic conditions prevailing at tranche 5 valuations dates. Plans have a shorter duration on average and a lower proportion have triggered on all triggers relative to tranche 4.
The average (unweighted) length of a tranche 5 recovery plan was 8.1 years; just over one year shorter than the average length of tranche 4 plans.
The proportion of schemes triggering overall was 60%, compared to 81% in tranche 4. In comparison to tranche 4, a smaller proportion of tranche 5 schemes triggered on investment return assumptions (15% compared to 34% in tranche 4) and on technical provisions (38% compared to 61% in tranche 4).
Discount rates
The average nominal single effective discount rate (SEDR) for tranche 5 is lower relative to that of tranches 2 and 3. The fall in average discount rates reflects the decline in UK gilt yields since the first cycle of valuations. Similarly, the real single effective discount rate fell to 1.76% in tranche 5, the lowest it has been over the five tranches.
The average nominal SEDR spread over UK conventional 20 year gilt yields increased from tranche 2 to tranche 5 (from 0.84% to 0.93%) although this is still lower than the 1.18% average outperformance in tranche 4.The average outperformance of the real single effective discount rate against >5 year IL gilts has increased from 0.84% in tranche 2 to 1.06% in tranche 5. This is lower than the average of 1.13% in tranche 4.
Schemes with the highest D&B[2] Failure scores (deemed least likely to become insolvent in the next year) had the highest real SEDR in tranche 5 while schemes with the lowest D&B Failure scores had the second highest SEDR.
Mortality
Nearly two thirds (62%) of tranche 5 schemes used 'S1' base mortality tables. 36% assumed a medium cohort projection for future improvements; 28%  long cohort  and 31% CMI 2009 projections. 95% of schemes applied an underpin. By comparison, 73% of tranche 2 schemes used '92' series base tables; 69% and 13% assumed medium and long cohort projections respectively; and 23% applied an underpin.
Average (unweighted) life expectancies increased marginally between tranches 4 and 5 with the average life expectancy of a male non-pensioner currently aged 45 rising from 89.1 to 89.4 years, and that of a male pensioner currently aged 65 rising from 87.1 to 87.3 years.
Changes in mortality assumptions from tranche 2 to tranche 5 translate to an increase of 0.8 years to the average (unweighted) assumed life expectancy of a male pensioner currently aged 65. The corresponding increase in average age for a male non-pensioner currently aged 45 is 1.5 years. It should be noted however, that increases in life expectancies do not necessarily reflect increases in prudence since some increases in life expectancies are included in all projection models.

(Sources: internal regulator data 31 December 2012, ASHE* 2011. Please note: the annual survey of hours and earnings reports 1.6 million active members of DC trust-based schemes and 240,000 active members in schemes where the type was unknown.)
Annual survey of hours and earnings, Office for National Statistics: rounded estimate of number of jobs where employee has taken up a workplace group personal or group stakeholder pension. This excludes individual personal pensions.
Excluded from this release are DC workplace personal pensions (referred to as contract-based schemes). DC contract-based schemes, made up of group personal pensions (GPPs) and group stakeholder pensions (GSHPs), are subject to a different regulatory framework from DC trust-based schemes. The regulator works jointly with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the regulation of workplace personal pensions (GPPs and GSHPs). Individual personal pensions sit outside of the remit of the regulator. Therefore, all types of DC contract-based provision, both group and individual, are outside of the scope of this statistics release.
Data collection
Pension schemes in the UK with two or more memberships are required to register with the regulator. At the point of registration, an occupational scheme provides their scheme name and contact details, their scheme status, membership information, and details about their employer(s), trustees and advisers.
In addition, the regulator operates a scheme return process. This is a statutory requirement, in the Pensions Act 2004. It is the principal means for the regulator to collect up-to-date information in regard to occupational pension schemes. The regulator operates a phased approach to the DC scheme return, with schemes of 12 or more members completing annually and schemes with two to 11 members completing once every three years. The regulator operates a web-based reporting tool. This offers several advantages, one of which is that schemes can log in to alter their details at any time (the scheme maintenance process). Scheme return notices are still sent to schemes annually or triennially as a reminder to update their details.
The scheme return requests further information for occupational trust-based DC schemes with 12 or more memberships, such as total annual contributions over the last year, and market value of scheme assets. For more information regarding the regulator’s scheme return, view our trustee scheme return guidance.
Footnotes for this section
[1] The effective date in this context refers to the date at which the data was extracted from the register. We also use the phrase effective date in section 5 to refer to when data was uploaded to the register by scheme return respondents.
[2] The regulator’s remit extends to all private sector pensions where an employer facilitates contribution payments, and therefore our figures exclude private personal pensions where an individual has purchased a product directly from a provider.

Changes from last year
We have sought to make improvements to this year's data release, by including time series data and including the results of questions which were added to the most recent scheme return.
Four years of snapshot data
As this is now the fourth version of the DC trust statistics release, and as previous versions have not been released with a common effective date, we have included a time series based on a series of snapshots of the pensions register, as at 31 December for each relevant year. This is to give the user one source for all years, and also to improve comparability between years.
Market value of scheme assets
The regulator has collected information with respect to the assets held by DC schemes with 12 or more members for the last four years. However, we have not previously published this figure as we felt that this could be misinterpreted as the total amount of money held in DC schemes (when in fact our results exclude micro DC schemes, hybrid schemes with DC members, and contract based DC schemes). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has released a figure estimating the total amount of assets in work place DC schemes in the UK as £385.9 billion. The regulator is therefore now able to present the information it holds on assets in DC schemes in this context.
Employer data
In last year's release information was included in respect of employers attached to schemes registered with the regulator. This year we have not included this information as we will soon be releasing a fuller picture of employer sponsors of pension schemes as part of the regulator's broader objective to maximise compliance with PA08.
Schemes year on year
In last year's release a table was shown which presented the regulator's estimate for the number of schemes with 12 or more DC members year on year going back to 1988. Two changes have been made to this table. Firstly, this is now based on all DC schemes with two or more members as this can be tracked more accurately. Secondly, the table now only goes back to 1997, the year that the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) first took on responsibility for the register. However, in the calculations tab we still show the number of registrations each year going back to 1988 in order to show the significant peak in 1988 (believed to have been caused by Income and Corporations Tax (ICTA) 1988 which allowed DC schemes to contract out of the state second pension).
Decumulation options
Two new questions were added to the DC return last year, aimed at enabling the regulator to identify what kinds of features were present in schemes with respect to decumulation options. The two added questions were:
Does your scheme offer lifetime annuities? And how many members are using this option?
Does your scheme self-annuitise? And how many members are using this option?
A scheme offering a lifetime annuity is one where at the point of retirement the scheme purchases an annuity in the name of the trustees, and then facilitates payment of that annuity to the member. A scheme offering self-annuitisation will calculate an annuity payment for the member and make the payment to the member directly from scheme funds. The results of these two questions are included in section 1.
Pensioner members
As a result of asking new questions in respect of decumulation options the regulator has become aware that its figures for pensioner members do not necessarily represent the number of members who have retired but remained in the scheme. Further, the regulator cannot be confident that the number of pensioner members represents the total number of retirees from that scheme (including those who transferred out). The regulator will seek to address this as part of its next scheme return but for this iteration pensioner memberships are excluded.
Back to top
Calculations
In most cases the data shown here is a direct cut of data held by the regulator. However, in some cases simple calculations are performed to provide what is considered to be more useful information. In that case, the direct data cuts from which the calculations are made are also included in a separate tab labeled 'calculations'.
Total schemes year on year
In order to create the time series of total schemes year on year we start with the total number of relevant schemes on the register as at 31 December 2012. We then use a table showing the total number of registrations each year, and the total number of schemes winding up each year. By removing the schemes established during 2012 and adding the schemes which wound up in that year, we create an estimate for the number of schemes as at 31 December 2011. We continue this process back to 1997 (the year when OPRA, the predecessor of The Pensions Regulator, took responsibility for maintaining the pensions register).
Market value of scheme assets
Whilst the significant majority of relevant schemes have provided us with their market value of scheme assets it is not completed by every scheme. Therefore, in order to estimate the total amount of assets within these schemes average assets per member is calculated for each scheme size banding (where size is based on number of members) for those schemes who have supplied the information. We then apply that average to the total number of members in that segment to extrapolate an estimate for the total amount of assets in DC trust schemes with 12 or more members.
Annual contributions
The issue for market value of scheme assets is also present for annual contributions. The same method is used to extrapolate an estimate for the total amount of contributions to trust-based DC schemes with 12 or more members. The difference with respect to contributions is that the average is calculated and the estimate extrapolated using active members, rather than all members as only active members are contributing. Please note the active membership figure could include members who were only active for part of the year.
Governance structure
The governance structure theme is designed to show both the number of schemes with multiple non-associated employers or master trusts, which are thought to be a potential growth area following automatic enrolment, and also to separate out those schemes which have been created by employers (unbundled) from those which have been purchased 'off the shelf' from a pension provider (bundled), and therefore have a single company providing all services. There is not a question on the scheme return which provides this split, and therefore an estimate is made by analysing data provided on insurer / administrator. Where the same company provides both administration and insurance services this is classed as a bundled scheme.

Determinations
The Pensions Regulator has a range of powers that it can use to intervene and help put things right, where necessary. The process used to decide if we will use one of these powers is called a 'determination'.
Carrying out determinations
A determination may take place when:
the regulator has investigated a case and has grounds for believing that a breach may have occurred which is within its power to sanction or prosecute;
a problem has arisen in a scheme that the regulator considers can be put right with the use of one of its powers; or
an application has been made by trustees, managers, members or employer of a scheme for the regulator to use one of its powers.
The regulator's staff have the discretion to use some of the powers - for example, clearance statements and improvement notices - but a range of major powers can only be exercised by the regulator's Determinations Panel .

Initial investigation by the regulator's case team
Cases in which the regulator’s decision must be made by the Determinations Panel are initially investigated by the regulator’s case teams.  If appropriate, these cases are then referred by the case teams to the Panel for a determination.
The case teams sit in an operational directorate of the regulator, operate separately from the Panel and ordinarily comprise a case manager (who will usually be the primary point of contact for any parties involved in the investigation), a lawyer, a business analyst and an actuary.
Back to top
Standard procedure
If, having investigated a case, the case team believes that the exercise of one or more of the regulator's functions may be appropriate (or, in certain cases, if it receives an application requesting it to exercise its function), it will follow a procedure known as 'standard procedure' and issue a warning notice.
A warning notice is a written statement setting out either why the case team believes that the exercise of the regulator's function(s) may be appropriate, or that the case team has received an application from a third party requesting it to exercise certain functions. The warning notice will attach documents that the case team has obtained that might reasonably be considered to support or undermine the case for the exercise of the function(s). The warning notice is sent to all those parties that the case team believe to be directly affected and these parties are then given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
The case is then subject to a further review by the case team and referred to the Determinations Panel if appropriate. The Determinations Panel will then progress the case to a determination.
Back to top
Special procedure
In some cases, the case team may believe that the Determinations Panel needs to exercise a function straightaway because there is an immediate risk to the interests of the members or the assets of a scheme. For example, where there is evidence that the trustees have been dishonest; the regulator may want to appoint a trustee with exclusive powers immediately to safeguard members' benefits or scheme assets.
In such cases the ‘special procedure’ will be applied and the case team will refer the matter to the Determinations Panel for a determination as soon as possible. This may mean that the usual steps followed in a standard procedure case may not happen, for example, a warning notice may not be given to the directly affected parties.
Where a case has been decided using the special procedure it is necessary for the Determinations Panel to conduct a ‘compulsory review’ as soon as reasonably practicable after the determination is made. Prior to the compulsory review, each party will be sent the papers that the Determinations Panel had before it when it made its determination and be given the opportunity to provide representations to be considered by the Determinations Panel. The Determinations Panel will consider any comments made, along with any relevant new information, when it makes its final decision.
At the compulsory review, the Determinations Panel may decide to confirm the original determination, amend it, or substitute a different determination.
Back to top
The determination
The Determinations Panel usually consists of at least two members who sit to consider whether or not to make a determination(s). A quorum is deemed to be two members. After a determination has been made, the parties will be advised of the determination in writing. This notification will explain:
what functions the regulator has exercised or will exercise
what facts were used to reach the decision
the reasons for the decision.
Staff Determinations
Not all determinations are made by the Determinations Panel. The Staff Determinations procedure describes the actions of the regulator for those functions where the decision whether (including how) to make the determination is made by a member of the regulator's staff.
Staff Determinations procedure (PDF, 123kb, 12 pages)
Publication
The regulator may also choose to publish the determination (but only after a compulsory review in special procedure cases).
Back to top
Appealing against a determination
Any (final) determination made by the Determinations Panel and most determinations under the Staff Determination procedure can be appealed. A party, other than the case team, has 28 days from the date of notification of the decision to make an appeal. An appeal is made to The Upper Tribunal and is called a 'reference'.
During the 28 days the regulator is not normally allowed to exercise the function decided at the determination (except in relation to the functions detailed in section 96(6) of the Act all of which can have immediate effect).
Back to top
The Upper Tribunal
The Upper Tribunal is the independent body set up to hear references on determinations, and it issues its own guidance on the form and content of a reference. Find the Upper Tribunal's rules under rules and legislation on the Justice website .
The Upper Tribunal may consider any evidence available to it in relation to the subject of the reference. This includes evidence that was not available at the time of the original determination.
It will decide whether to:
confirm the determination and any order, notice or direction
vary or revoke the determination and any order, notice or direction
substitute a different determination, order, notice or direction.
The regulator must act in accordance with the direction of the Tribunal.
Prohibition of trustees
Published determinations
The regulator's policy is to publish in full, all determinations, unless it considers there is good reason not to.
Exceptions to publishing a determination, or publishing it in full, will be considered where publication would give rise to one or more of the following:
an adverse impact on market behaviours – which can include commercial and/or price sensitivity issues
prejudice investigations by other bodies
disclosure of information protected under the Official Secrets Act or unrelated restricted information
risk to individual safety or mental health (in relation to reputational and civil liability)
disclosure of sensitive personal data.

Prohibition of trustees
The Determinations Panel
Members of the Determinations Panel are people with legal, business and / or pensions knowledge. The structure of the Determinations Panel is set out in Section 9 of the Pensions Act 2004 which requires the Determinations Panel to consist of:
a chairman (appointed by the regulator); and
at least six other persons (nominated by the chairman of the Panel and  appointed by the regulator).
Further provision about the Determinations Panel is made in Schedule 1 to the Act, including provision as to the terms of appointment, tenure and remuneration of members and its procedure.

Members' expenses
We publish the expenses for the regulator's Determinations Panel chair and members for each quarter. This includes all expenses incurred for travel, accommodation and meals etc, as well as any hospitality given to others. A separate sheet shows any hospitality received by these individuals in their capacity as the regulator's Determinations Panel members during the specified quarter.
Some explanatory notes:
Expenses are incurred by the regulator's Determinations Panel members in two ways. Either individuals spend their own money whilst on the regulator's business and then claim it back (see staff and board / panel expenses policies in our Publication Scheme) or, particularly for travel and accommodation that needs to be booked in advance, the regulator makes bookings directly and is invoiced for the cost. For this reason, these expenses will be published for the quarter in which they were paid, and therefore may not necessarily appear alongside other expenses (claimed back in arrears) for the same trip.

Valuation summary
You can now complete and submit your valuation summary form online using Exchange .
A valuation summary is a form to be completed when a recovery plan and schedule of contributions have been agreed by the trustees and the employer, following an actuarial valuation.
To fully comply with these requirements, and to ensure appropriate data validation and processing, a new valuation summary and the accompanying recovery plan and schedule of contributions should be submitted online using Exchange, for each valuation submitted.
Recovery plan revisions and supporting explanations should also be submitted online using Exchange.
Information regarding your scheme funding valuation and recovery plan
When a scheme is required to introduce or retain a recovery plan following an actuarial valuation*, the trustees or managers of a scheme are required to send a copy of the recovery plan and schedule of contributions to the Pensions Regulator.
There is a requirement (under Scheme Funding Regulations (SI 2005/3377) regulation 8(7)(a)) to accompany this with a summary of the information contained in the valuation. This is explained in greater detail in paragraph 155 of our Code of practice 03: Funding defined benefits .
Where there are subsequent, ad hoc revisions to a recovery plan, there is also a requirement under regulation 8(7)(b) to submit the updated plan, along with an explanation of the reasons for the revisions.

Approaching funding
The trustees’ approach to scheme funding cannot be implemented in isolation from their fiduciary and other duties (under both the rules of their scheme and legislation or trust law). The circumstances of both the scheme and employer are also crucial.
The trustees’ key objective is to pay promised benefits as they fall due. They may also have additional aims: for example, maintaining the relationship between the scheme and employer, de-risking or (where required, with employer agreement) the preservation of ongoing benefit accrual.
Trustees must have appropriate knowledge and understanding of the principles which relate to scheme funding[15] to understand the possible funding approaches for their scheme.
Part 3 provides the statutory framework for how the trustees must assess their scheme’s liabilities and determine the pace and period over which these liabilities must be funded. Part 3 sits alongside the scheme’s own funding rules[16]. As there is no single typical scheme, the funding solution under Part 3 will always be scheme-specific.
The responsibilities of trustees and the employer
Whilst it is the trustees who take the decisions on a scheme’s funding position and who must be comfortable that certain statutory tests are met[17], agreement must normally be reached with the employer on the contents of the funding documents[18].
Collaborative working
Trustees and employers should therefore work together in an open and transparent manner to reach funding solutions that strike the right balance between the needs of the scheme and those of the employer. They should engage early and often. This engagement will be valuable even where not mandated. Where negotiation is necessary, it is important to work together as partners to explore whether it is possible to reach agreement.
To form their views, the trustees should engage with and obtain relevant information from the employer at an early stage in the valuation process. In turn the employer must provide the trustees with the information they or their professional advisers reasonably require to perform their respective duties[19]. This includes information reasonably required to assess the employer covenant. Employers will appreciate the value of volunteering information about their plans (including those for growth) so that these can be considered when reaching funding decisions.
Trustees should not be refused information to which they are otherwise entitled because of concerns over stock exchange requirements or other confidentiality issues[20]. They should, however, be aware of the potentially sensitive nature of the information and any constraints on disclosure by the employer. Potential employer concerns can be overcome by the trustees entering into a confidentiality agreement with the employer and/or using trustee sub-committees. Where constraints on disclosure exist, trustees should co-operate with the employer in taking steps to overcome those restraints where possible.
Managing conflicts
Managing conflicts of interests and duties properly is vital. Trustees should have a process in place which effectively identifies, documents, monitors and manages conflicts and potential conflicts.
Given the importance and sensitivity of funding negotiations, trustees need to understand when actual or potential conflicts arise. Where conflicted, a trustee should consider withdrawing from negotiations. Where there are acute or pervasive conflicts or tensions associated with the trustee’s role (for example where the trustee is also the finance director) it is likely to be inappropriate for the trustee to continue to be involved in those negotiations. Not all conflicts are employer-related. They can also arise for trustees who, for example, are members of the scheme or who hold trade union representative roles.
Trustees also need to be aware that their service providers and advisers could also have conflicts. Where a conflict is identified to the trustees they should understand how it is being managed.
Agreeing a funding solution
It is important that trustees are always able to demonstrate that they have acted in line with their fiduciary duties in an impartial, independent manner when complying with the requirements of Part 3. In the unlikely event that those requirements are not met (even after engagement and collaborative working between both parties) then the trustees should not agree the actuarial valuation as they would be compromising the scheme’s funding position.
A limited number of schemes may not be able to put in place an adequate scheme funding solution (ie one which is appropriate in the context of the employer covenant without an unacceptable level of investment risk being run). The trustees of these schemes should be prepared to address the implications of this for paying benefits. Continued future accrual of benefits is unlikely to be appropriate. Other consequences might include consideration of whether the scheme should be wound up or how the scheme’s interests in the employer are protected or realised.
Trustees should document their considerations and reasons for decisions. They should be in a position to be able to explain the decisions based on the interplay of the different information and advice strands they have received.
When performing their duties under Part 3, trustees should not take into account the potential for the PPF to provide compensation to members of the scheme.

An integrated approach to risk management
It is not necessary to eradicate risks completely. Trustees may wish to embrace a degree of risk in seeking opportunities to capture potentially significant associated rewards for both the scheme and employer. Accepting appropriate risk can significantly help to minimise any adverse impact on the employer’s sustainable growth which in turn helps the trustees to meet their key funding objective to pay promised benefits.
Risk should be understood and managed appropriately. Trustees should understand the likely upsides and downsides of proposals and be comfortable with the extent to which the employer can address the likely adverse outcomes over an appropriate period. Trustees should engage with the employer to establish its appetite for risk and tolerance to downside events. Trustees should note that it is not necessary for the employer to be able to cover all conceivable risks or that those it is covering be repaired immediately should they crystallise.
Assessing risk
If they are not already doing so, trustees should adopt a proportionate[21] integrated approach to risk management when developing an appropriate scheme funding solution. The resources committed to this should be commensurate with the benefits the approach is expected to deliver for the scheme and employer.
Schemes face many risks to achieving their funding plans. These broadly fall into those which are:
employer covenant-related
investment-related and
funding-related.
As part of a risk management approach, trustees should understand the risks across all of these strands and define acceptable parameters for each within which they seek to manage the scheme. This understanding also helps the trustees to strike the right balance between these risk parameters.
In general, employer covenant, funding and investment decisions interact so that a material change to one affects the other two. Trustees should proportionately[22] monitor key indicators so that, where such a change occurs, they can make timely adjustments (if appropriate) designed to preserve the scheme’s funding balance.
An integrated approach does not need to be expensive or standalone. Some aspects may already be, and continue to be, recorded within either or both of the statement of funding principles and the statement of investment principles for the scheme. The focus should not be on paperwork or excessive quantification. Instead the approach should be embedded within the trustees’ governance framework. Emphasis should be placed on the actions trustees should take when risks begin to crystallise.
Risk management in the funding landscape
Effective integrated risk management is an internal control for the scheme and represents an appropriate scheme risk management cycle[23]. Once they have set objectives for scheme funding, trustees should:
understand the employer covenant, investment and funding risks to those objectives and the interaction between these risks
have a funding and investment strategy to achieve these objectives
set an appropriate risk appetite
agree appropriate management actions and contingency plans; and
establish a framework to assess, monitor and control:
scheme risks
progress against the trustees’ strategy; and
any changes required.
Integrated risk management steps
Understanding risks
Trustees should seek to understand the risks across the employer covenant, investment and funding strands. In particular trustees should understand the extent of the scheme’s reliance on the employer covenant over time on the basis of a range of plausible future scenarios. These scenarios should capture investment risk, the impact of potential or actual maturing of the scheme and the impact of the contribution patterns which are proposed for the scheme (and the risks to those contribution patterns) compared to the employer covenant available under various scenarios. This is because the employer underwrites both the short- and long-term risks to which a scheme is exposed.
Tools for understanding risks
It is important for trustees to appreciate that all the risk assessment tools only illustrate possible outcomes. They do not predict how a scheme’s assets and liabilities will behave. Their value lies in helping trustees to appreciate the order of magnitude of the scheme risks, the broad trade-offs and the options available for managing these risks. Trustees should assess and weigh the inputs they receive relative to the various other inputs. They are encouraged to use a variety of qualitative and quantitative approaches (for example, scenario testing and stress testing) to assess the impact of adverse events on potential employer covenant, investments and funding plans. The approaches used should be proportionate[24] to scheme and employer circumstances.
Approaching risks
When approaching the assessment of risk, trustees should remember that pensions are deferred pay. If the funding strategy is unsuccessful and the employer is unable to make up the shortfall this deferred pay will not be delivered.
It is useful for trustees to consider how other organisations, which find themselves in a position of being creditors (such as banks), seek to protect themselves against the risk of the non-payment of money owed by counterparties. Applying some of these techniques to the scheme’s circumstances could result in the provision of adequate and risk-controlled collateral or guarantees (the scheme’s actual and contingent assets) and/or the use of controls around employer behaviour (for example, negative pledges and monitoring).
Setting strategies
Strategies set by the trustees should be specific, measurable, appropriate, realistic and time-bound. Setting acceptable strategies involves establishing the balance between the risks which they consider to be appropriate for the scheme given its and the employer’s circumstances. Trustees should consider a wide range of questions and issues such as:
what risks are controllable and what are not
the likelihood and consequences of each of these being realised
what risks they are prepared to take
what risks would they like to mitigate in full or in part
proposed risk controls and volatility of results; and
vulnerability of the scheme and the employer covenant.
This analysis should enable trustees, in discussion with the employer, to identify material risks and set parameters within which they seek to manage the scheme risks. The ability of the trustees to take different levels of risk dependent on their appetite should be informed by their assessment of the employer’s own tolerance to risk. The trustees’ ability to manage and address these risks, is a key flexibility which can be used to minimise any adverse impact on an employer’s sustainable growth. The level of tolerable risk and the flexibilities set by the trustees should be consistent with their key objective to pay promised benefits.
Monitoring risk
Effective risk management should be an ongoing process. Material changes can occur between actuarial valuations.
This is why trustees should have a framework in place to apply proportionately[25] when it comes to on-going monitoring. This should enable them to quickly identify changes in the environment and balance of risks.
Employer covenant, investment performance and scheme funding levels can change rapidly and changes can be very different in their nature. Some employer covenant changes may be significant and expected to be permanent, others may not. Similarly, investment values fluctuate constantly with market changes but not all fluctuations will endure or have a lasting adverse impact. Trustees should exercise judgment about the materiality and permanence of changes.
Contingency planning
Trustee risk management plans should identify the potential steps they may take to preserve an appropriately balanced[26] funding strategy and when to take those steps.
Trustees should have a view on the range of likely adverse outcomes that could apply and have an adequate and flexible strategy and governance structure to address these outcomes. This planning should be proportionate[27]. It may be as valuable to the employer as it is for the scheme because potential volatility can be damaging for both. In simple form, it can involve the identification of triggers for provision of information and review and discussion by both trustees and employer of how matters might be addressed.
Where trustees agree with the employer to accept more risk than can be supported by the available employer covenant, contingency plans will need to be more definitive as they can provide additional support for the scheme. The plans should be aimed at preventing risk from escalating to levels which the trustees would not find acceptable. They can also be used in anticipation of an improved position (so that, for example, employer concerns over potential scheme funding surplus can be addressed). Options available include:
provision of contingent assets

Appendix: Corresponding Northern Ireland legislation
Introduction
This code of practice (the DC code) is issued by The Pensions Regulator (the ‘regulator’), the body that regulates occupational and personal pension schemes provided through employers.
The regulator’s statutory objectives[1] are to:
protect the benefits of pension scheme members
reduce the risks of calls on the Pension Protection Fund
promote, and improve understanding of, the good administration of work-based pension schemes
maximise compliance with the duties and safeguards of the Pensions Act 2008.
The regulator has a number of regulatory tools, including issuing codes of practice, to enable it to meet its statutory objectives.
Codes of practice provide practical guidelines on the requirements of pensions legislation. They set out standards of conduct and practice expected of those who must meet these requirements[2].
Status of codes of practice
Codes of practice are not statements of the law and there is no penalty for failing to comply with them. It is not necessary for all the provisions of a code of practice to be followed in every circumstance. Any alternative approach to that appearing in the code of practice will nevertheless need to meet the underlying legal requirements and a penalty may be imposed if these requirements are not met. When determining whether the legal requirements have been met, a court or tribunal must take any relevant provisions of a code of practice into account[3].
If there are grounds to issue an improvement notice, the regulator may issue a notice directing a person to take, or refrain from taking, such steps as are specified in the notice. These directions may be worded by reference to a code of practice issued by the regulator[4].
This code of practice
This DC code is underpinned by a number of defined contribution (DC) quality features that describe those activities, behaviours and control processes that are more likely to deliver good member outcomes. The DC quality features are set in the context of their legal requirements and represent the standards we expect trustees to attain. They will help trustees to demonstrate they are complying with legal requirements.
The practical guidance sections in this DC code are not intended to prescribe the process for every scenario. They do, however, provide principles, examples and benchmarks against which trustees can consider whether or not they are reasonably complying with and have understood their duties and obligations.
If trustees are, for any reason, unable to act in accordance with the procedures set out in this DC code, or an alternative approach that meets the underlying requirements, they should consider their statutory duty under section 70 of the Pensions Act 2004 to assess and if necessary report breaches of the law.
To whom is this code directed?
This DC code applies to trustees of all occupational DC trust-based pension schemes with two or more members (whether active, deferred or pensioner) which offer the following types of benefit:
money purchase benefits, including additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) under occupational defined benefit (DB) trust-based pension schemes or sections and the DC element of hybrid schemes
money purchase benefits with a DB underpin: we would normally expect these benefits to be treated as money purchase benefits throughout their lifetime but with the relevant DB legislation and supporting codes of practice and guidance also applied to the underpin (as trustees must ensure that appropriate funding is in place for the underpin).
This DC code also applies where governance and administration functions described in the DC code applicable to trustees have been delegated to a sub-committee or outsourced.
This DC code does not apply to:
schemes providing DB benefits only or DB benefits in hybrid schemes
work-based personal pensions, stakeholder schemes or other contract-based schemes.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this DC code impacts on these two types of arrangements. These continue as described in existing codes and guidance issued by the regulator.
Terms used in this code
For the purpose of this DC code, reference to ‘trustees’ includes trustee directors of a corporate trustee.
How to use this code
The DC code is structured as a reference document to be used by trustees to inform their actions in five core areas of scheme governance.
While trustees need to be familiar with the DC code as a whole, we suggest they work through each section systematically. For example, trustees could prioritise sections of the DC code and work through the detail on a modular basis.
In certain areas, the practical guidance sections have been drafted to address issues which may be more relevant to particular types of schemes, for example master trusts.
We define a master trust as an occupational trust-based pension scheme established by declaration of trust which is or has been promoted to provide benefits to employers which are not connected and where each employer group is not included in a separate section with its own trustees. For this purpose, employers are connected if they are part of the same group of companies (including partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures).
Other relevant codes of practice
The DC code provides trustees with a central point of reference for areas of governance addressed by the DC quality features. The DC code draws on information already contained in two other codes of practice – Code of practice no. 7: Trustee knowledge and understanding and Code of practice no. 9: Internal controls and builds on the requirements from a DC perspective.
Trustees should also read the following codes of practice in conjunction with this DC code:
Reporting breaches of the law
Trustee knowledge and understanding (TKU)
Internal controls
Reporting late payment of contributions to occupational pension schemes
Member-nominated trustees/member-nominated directors – putting arrangements in place
Early leavers – reasonable periods
Dispute resolution – reasonable periods.
Trustees of schemes which offer hybrid benefits should read this DC code alongside all our codes.
Relationship with the DC regulatory guidance
The DC code and DC regulatory guidance: Governance and administration of occupational defined contribution trust-based pension schemes address the DC quality features that we expect to be present in all occupational DC trust-based schemes that provide money purchase benefits.
The DC code focuses on quality features that are related to the requirements of pensions legislation and the DC regulatory guidance covers those quality features that reflect our view of good practice.
Trustees should read the DC code and DC regulatory guidance in conjunction with each other.

Understanding trustees' duties
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
understand their duties and be fit and proper to carry them out
ensure that sufficient time and resources are identified and made available for maintaining the ongoing governance of the scheme.
Legal requirements
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes must have knowledge and understanding of:
law relating to pensions and trusts
principles relating to investment matters[5].
In relation to a trustee’s knowledge of pensions and trusts law, trustees must have an appropriate degree of knowledge and understanding to enable them to properly exercise their functions as a trustee[6].
Trustees must be conversant with (ie have a working knowledge of) relevant scheme documents to be able to use them effectively when carrying out their duties. Relevant documents include the scheme rules, the scheme’s statement of investment principles and any other documents which relate to administration of the scheme.
Trustees with any special knowledge or experience, or who act as a trustee in the course of a business or profession, must meet a higher standard of care as set out in the Trustee Act 2000[7]. In relation to investment, all trustees must take advice from professional advisers regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000[8]. They must use special knowledge or experience in a manner that would reasonably be expected of a person acting in the course of that kind of business or profession. When considering the internal controls provisions[9] in the Pensions Act 2004, trustees will have to manage these obligations.
Practical guidance to help trustees[10]
Deciding what level of knowledge is required
Trustees should read their scheme’s rules, deeds of amendment, statement of investment principles, payment schedule, member booklets and other key member communications. They should understand these documents in enough detail to know where to refer to a particular provision in the event an issue arises.
For example, to aid discussions around investment options, trustees should be familiar with the scope of their investment power. They should understand key elements of their statement of investment principles and identify any constraints to investment decision-making.
We expect a trustee’s breadth of knowledge and understanding to be sufficient to allow the trustee to understand fully any advice they are given. We expect trustees to be able to challenge any advice they are given and understand how advice impacts on any decisions for which they are legally responsible.
The level of knowledge and understanding required of trustees will vary according to the role and expertise of the trustee and the type of scheme. For example, we expect a trustee of an occupational DC trust-based pension scheme who is also an investment expert (for instance as a result of their day job) to have a greater level of knowledge than what we would consider appropriate for trustees without this background. However, all trustees should attain appropriate knowledge so that they are able to understand the key areas around investment in some detail.
A professional trustee (ie someone who acts as a trustee in the course of their business or profession and charges for their services) is expected to have a higher level of knowledge than a lay trustee.
What trustees need to know
The benefits that the scheme offers
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes should be familiar with the benefits offered under their scheme. In particular, they should understand what constitutes a money purchase benefit as described in the Pensions Act 2011 and be familiar with exactly where their scheme fits within this. In the case of hybrid schemes, trustees should ensure they understand the differences between the treatment of money purchase benefits and DB benefits, and how money purchase assets are held compared with the DB assets.
Details of the types of benefits offered are usually described in the scheme rules so it is important that trustees understand these. They are also described sometimes in members’ terms of employment. While trustees are not expected to review members’ terms and conditions of employment, they may want the employer(s) to confirm that scheme benefits are consistent with terms of employment.
Trustees should also establish whether the employer(s) intends their scheme to be used as an automatic enrolment scheme.
The scope of trustees’ powers under the rules
Trustees of occupational DC trust-based pension schemes must understand the extent of key DC powers in their scheme rules[11], which includes the following.
The scope of the trustees’ investment power. Trustees should review this power to understand the extent (if any) to which their power of investment under the rules is limited.
The scope of the trustees’ power to amend their scheme. Trustees should establish who has the ability to amend the scheme rules – is it the trustees, employer, provider (in the case of master trusts) or a joint power? This rule is key as it determines who has the power to change future service benefits, for example where contribution structures are written into the rules.
Who has the power to appoint and remove trustees.
On what basis the trustees can act. For example, whether decisions are made by majority vote or must be unanimous. Specific arrangements for the numbers and identities of trustees signing documents are often made outside the scheme rules, but trustees should establish what these arrangements are and ensure they are clearly documented.
Whether trustee powers to appoint or remove advisers are limited.
Who has the power to authorise bulk transfers in and out of the scheme.
The scope of the power to terminate and wind up the scheme. In particular, trustees should ensure they understand the process involved to ensure the security of members’ benefits on winding up.
Key issues for trustee meetings
Trustees need to make sufficient time to discuss key issues affecting their scheme. The issues that are likely to appear as regular agenda items include the following.
Investment monitoring to address the appropriateness of investment strategies (particularly the default strategy) and fund choices. Trustees should periodically invite managers to attend meetings to discuss reports, evaluate market conditions and consider reasons for short-term fluctuations in performance.
Scheme risks to determine whether the profile of key risks has changed.
Scheme costs and charges to assess costs and charges incurred by the scheme and all scheme members.
Administration to ensure the administration services provided to the scheme are of a good standard. In-house and third-party administrators should be asked to attend trustee meetings and to provide regular (for example quarterly) updates.
Communications to ensure that information sent to members (both active and deferred) is accurate, clear, understandable and engaging.
Legal update to raise awareness of and understand any changes in the law (including legislation, case law and ombudsman determinations) which affect DC provision.
Trustee training to ensure that trustees understand relevant issues where a gap in their knowledge has been identified or as new issues emerge.
Where schemes offer DB and DC benefits, it is important that trustees devote sufficient time to DC matters. It is not appropriate to tag on an important DC-related discussion at the end of a trustee meeting. Trustees should set aside enough time at meetings to address DC issues in detail. However, it may not be appropriate to have regular meetings devoted simply to AVCs where a scheme offers DB or hybrid benefits.
Trustees must keep written records of meetings[12] which show the:
date, time and place of the meeting
names of trustees invited
names of trustees (and others such as scheme advisers) who were at the meeting
names of trustees who were not at the meeting
decisions made
date, time and place of any decisions made at the last meeting, including urgent decisions and the names of trustees who took part.
Newly appointed trustees
Newly appointed individual trustees have a period of six months from the date they are appointed as trustee to complete the required learning[13]. This period is designed to give new trustees time to acquire necessary knowledge and understanding. Newly appointed lay trustees should start immediately to acquire the appropriate knowledge and understanding. This should include familiarising themselves with the scheme’s trust deed, rules and relevant documents.
Even a new trustee is accountable in law and must be equipped to make the decisions with which they might be faced. Therefore, trustees should consider offering pre-appointment training and requiring candidates to attain sufficient levels of knowledge and understanding before appointment. This will give them the necessary skills to undertake their role effectively straight away. Trustees should also consider arranging for experienced trustees to mentor new trustees.
Newly appointed professional trustees or trustee directors have a higher duty of care[14] and should bring their experience and knowledge to the scheme upon appointment. They should have a Pensions Management Institute qualification or equivalent knowledge before they are appointed.
Trustees with a specialist role
Trustees who have a specialist role are expected to acquire a detailed level of knowledge to enable them to undertake their role properly. For example, where investment decisions are delegated to an investment sub-committee, the sub-committee should include members who have detailed investment knowledge.
Trustees must be aware that their individual legal duties to meet the appropriate levels of knowledge and understanding are not waived when functions are delegated to a sub-committee. This remains the case even if the sub-committee has specialised expertise and has been authorised by the main board to carry out the work or make a particular decision on the board’s behalf.
Reviewing and updating skills and knowledge
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
regularly review their skills and competencies to demonstrate they understand their duties and are fit and proper to carry them out
ensure that accountability and delegated responsibilities for all elements of running the scheme are identified, documented and understood by those involved.
Legal requirements
An individual must have an appropriate degree of knowledge and understanding to enable them properly to exercise their function as a trustee[15]. Trustees should keep their knowledge and understanding up to date so that it remains relevant.
Practical guidance to help trustees[16]
Trustees need to ensure that their level of knowledge and understanding remains appropriate throughout their term of office. This includes:
ensuring that training is a regular point of discussion at trustee meetings
reviewing their individual levels of knowledge and understanding at least annually to help identify and address any knowledge gaps
ensuring they are suitably prepared before discussions on upcoming changes affecting the scheme where trustees may have limited experience, for example corporate activities.
Trustees should ensure that, where possible, they plan ahead for training and development requirements in preparation for scheme activities that may require new skill sets.
Training programme
Where an assessment identifies any knowledge gaps or weaknesses which could hinder performance, these should be documented and addressed promptly in a training programme.
Trustees should log all training undertaken. This will help demonstrate how they have mitigated risks associated with knowledge gaps.
The training programme should cover key areas such as:
setting an investment objective and strategy for the scheme’s default strategy
reviewing performance against the scheme’s longer term investment strategy
how to select appropriate fund options for members to choose from
how to monitor adviser and service provider performance
how administration of the scheme is carried out and controlled
the balance of powers between the trustees and the sponsoring employer under the scheme rules
decumulation issues, for example the processes leading up to retirement, flexible retirement and annuity options, understanding issues around open market options and communicating retirement options to members
understanding how certain events such as a merger, closure or full or partial wind-ups will affect the scheme and what needs to be done.
Trustees should make time to attend training courses and undertake independent learning to address knowledge gaps.
Trustee toolkit
We have developed the Trustee toolkit ( trusteetoolkit.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk ), a free online training course that addresses knowledge and understanding required by trustees. Successful completion of the Trustee toolkit can help trustees to evidence that they have the appropriate knowledge and understanding. The Trustee toolkit enables users to print out their general progress through the toolkit as well as a certificate upon successful completion.
Trustees must complete the Trustee toolkit or demonstrate that they otherwise meet the requirement for appropriate knowledge and understanding. This might include a record of other educational qualifications or courses attended but whatever route is chosen the appropriate level of knowledge and understanding must be obtained within six months of being appointed[17].
Fitness and propriety
Trustees need to be fit and proper to carry out their duties[18]. We expect trustees to act honestly and with integrity, competence and capability, and financial soundness. When looking at fitness and propriety we will take a number of issues into account, including:
any attempt to deceive
any misuse of trust funds
any breaches of trust law, particularly if these are significant, persistent, deliberate or contrary to legal advice received
if a trustee’s charges were to constitute a breach of trust or demonstrate a lack of internal controls
if trustees persistently or seriously commit breaches of law (including pensions legislation)
criminal convictions (other than those noted under section 29 of the Pensions Act 1995) so far as these are not spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. These convictions are not limited to those involving dishonesty or deception and could involve convictions for money laundering, violence or substance abuse, for example.
When employers and trustees consider applications for new trustee appointments they should consider, as part of the recruitment process, the fitness and propriety requirements of all candidates. They should also review the fitness and propriety of all appointed trustees on an ongoing basis.

[18] Section 3(1) of the Pensions Act 1995.
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
establish and maintain adequate internal controls which mitigate significant operational, financial, regulatory and compliance risks
ensure that sufficient time and resources are identified and made available for maintaining the ongoing governance of the scheme.
Legal requirements
Trustees must establish and operate internal controls which adequately ensure that the scheme is administered and managed in accordance with the scheme rules and the requirements of the law[19]. ‘Internal controls’ are defined in the legislation as:
arrangements and procedures to be followed in the administration and management of the scheme
systems and arrangements for monitoring that administration and management
arrangements and procedures to be followed for the safe custody and security of the assets of the scheme.
If trustees persistently fail to put in place adequate internal controls, this may cause an administrative breach, maladministration or, in more extreme cases, result in the reduction or loss of scheme assets.
Where the effect and wider implication of not having in place adequate internal controls are likely to be materially significant, we expect to receive a whistleblowing report that outlines information relating to the breach[20].
Practical guidance to help trustees[21]
Trustees must identify, evaluate and manage the risks that relate to their scheme[22].
Stage 1: Identifying risks
Trustees must identify the risks that are critical to the scheme and which are likely to have a material impact on the scheme’s ability to provide member benefits if they are not managed effectively.
Trustees should consider information drawn from a number of sources to help identify risks present in their scheme. This includes internal audit reports, service contracts, complaints, administration reports and external audit reporting.
Areas of risk that are likely to have a significant impact on an occupational DC trust-based pension scheme include:
fraud (including pension liberation fraud) and the importance of independent oversight
investment
corporate activity relevant to the scheme
retirement and members’ decumulation options.
Once trustees have identified risk areas they should record them in a risk register. Recording risks helps to formalise risk management procedures and provides trustees with a central reference point for future trustee meetings.
Stage 2: Evaluating risks
Not all risks will have the same potential impact or the same likelihood of materialising. Trustees need to look at both these areas and assess which risks the scheme can absorb without the need to take further action, and which risks require adequate internal controls to reduce their incidence and impact.
Trustees must therefore develop a process for evaluating risks and consider the impact that risks may, or will, have on scheme operations and assess the probability of a risk materialising.
The evaluation process must reflect the effectiveness of controls against suitable success criteria. It should consider the impact and likelihood of a risk occurring.
The basis upon which trustees measure the impact of risks may vary. However, the model below describes one simple approach trustees could use to evaluate risks. This measures the likelihood of risks occurring against the impact on the scheme.
In this model the classification of risk – for example red, amber or green – dictates the extent to which trustees need to take mitigating action. It is dependent upon a number of factors, including judgement. A risk categorised as red requires immediate attention as it represents a significant threat to the scheme. Where possible, these risks should be avoided altogether.
This is one approach trustees could use to evaluate risks. There are other risk assessment models which trustees might use that are just as effective.
Whichever model the trustees choose, the evaluation process should help trustees to direct resources to priority areas. It is important that trustees address all risks in a sensible order of priority, starting with those which will have the greatest impact on their scheme.
Stage 3: Managing risk
Simply recording and evaluating risk does not mean that risks are being managed. As part of the management and decision-making process, trustees must ensure that controls are suitably designed and implemented to enable them to take appropriate action. Trustees should consider a number of issues including those in the following table.
How the control is performed and the skills of the person performing the control.
For example, master trusts may have a large number of employers with limited experience of pension scheme administration. Trustees of master trust schemes should ensure that employers receive clear instructions addressing information requirements and support to help manage the risk of transmitting poor quality data.
The level of reliance that can be placed on information technology (IT) solutions if processes are automated.
For example, if administration services are provided using an automated system, external auditors could audit the system on an annual basis on behalf of the trustees and should audit if any issues are identified.
Whether or not a control would stop something from happening or merely detect something that has already happened.
For example, it is not possible to prevent a significant fall in global markets. However, an investment subcommittee should ensure that the main trustee board is informed enough to make a particular decision or recommendation to the main board for quick approval (subject to taking appropriate investment advice).
The frequency and timeliness of a control process.
For example, trustees who find their data is incomplete should undertake data-cleansing or member-tracing exercises and review this on a regular basis (at least annually).
The process or reporting mechanism for flagging errors or control failures.
For example, if trustees identify that member communications are poor quality, they should ensure that they are reviewed and, if necessary, redrafted.
Stage 4: Effective monitoring of risk management controls
Risk management is an ongoing process. Trustees must continually review exposure to new and emerging risks, including significant changes in or affecting the scheme.
Establishing effective internal controls relating to risk management is not a one-off exercise. Trustees should review the risk register in detail at least annually and evaluate their risk assessment arrangements, procedures and systems for material changes. They should record these changes (usually on the risk register itself) with any agreed actions to mitigate the risk.

setting investment objectives and a default strategy
security and liquidity of scheme assets
monitoring and reviewing the default strategy
reviewing investment fund performance
investment decision-making and trustee knowledge
acting in the best interests of members and beneficiaries.
Setting investment objectives and a default strategy
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
ensure that investment objectives for each investment option are identified and documented in order for them to be regularly monitored
ensure that the number and risk profile of investment options offered reflects the needs of the membership
ensure that a default strategy is provided which is suitable for the needs of the membership
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees of most schemes are responsible for deciding the investment objectives and strategy adopted by the scheme. Only trustees of fully insured schemes do not need to make this decision.
Trustees have a very wide power to invest scheme assets. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the scheme rules, trustees have the same power to make investments of any kind as if they were absolutely entitled to the assets of the scheme[23].
Trustees need to consider the interests of both active and deferred members in a scheme when they make decisions relating to investment options.
Schemes which are not fully insured must also draw up a written statement of investment principles[24]. This statement sets out the trustees’ investment objectives for their scheme and the principles governing how decisions about investments must be made. A statement of investment principles should include the trustees’ policy on the following issues:
setting the investment objective and defining, monitoring and reviewing the default strategy
monitoring and reviewing all investments and investment funds in which the scheme assets are invested
choosing investments and investment funds, and the balance between different kinds of investment and investment funds
risk, including how risk is to be measured and managed, and the expected return on investments
realising investments
the extent to which the trustees take account of social, environmental or ethical considerations when taking investment decisions
using the rights (including voting rights) attached to investments (if the trustees have them).
Trustees must review the statement of investment principles regularly – including whenever there has been a significant change in investment policy[25].
Trustees have a statutory duty to consult with the employer about the scheme’s statement of investment principles[26].
Practical guidance to help trustees[27]
Understanding trustees’ power to invest
Trustees are responsible for investment governance and must be familiar with and understand the scope of the power of investment that is described in their scheme rules[28].
Trustees should use their scheme rules to identify investment powers they may delegate. They should consider whether it is sensible to establish an investment sub-committee. If they do, the trustees should document the delegation of any investment powers in an investment governance plan or as part of the statement of investment principles.
Trustees should be clear that they are responsible for setting and monitoring the default strategy, and for ensuring the long-term suitability of the funds underlying the default strategy. However, in relation to the range of individual funds available for members to choose to invest in, it is the members who set their strategy and the responsibility of the trustees is limited to ensuring that the funds offered perform in line with the manager’s stated objectives.
Setting a default strategy
A default strategy (made up of one or more investment funds) will be selected automatically for a member joining the scheme, unless the member chooses to set their own strategy and chooses funds themselves from those made available by the trustees. Some schemes offer a range of pre-set, risk-rated strategies for members to choose from, although one of these will usually be set as the default strategy for members who fail to make a selection.
Schemes used for automatic enrolment must offer a default strategy[29] as new joiners must not be asked to make a choice or provide information in order to become an active member of a qualifying scheme.
Trustees of all occupational DC trust-based pension schemes have a duty to exercise their powers in the interests of members and beneficiaries[30]. With the exception of AVC investments (where default strategies are rarely offered), and where they have determined this is appropriate, trustees should provide a suitable default strategy even where a scheme is not being used for automatic enrolment.
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has issued guidance[31] on offering a default strategy for DC automatic enrolment pension schemes. This is intended to support existing legislation. Using a high-level, principles-based approach, it covers governance, design, review, monitoring and communication of the default strategy.
Trustees should allow suitable time to design the default strategy and ensure that the membership data on which the default strategy is based is accurate. What is a suitable default strategy will vary from scheme to scheme depending on the needs and demographic profile of the membership.
Trustees should take care to understand and monitor the member-borne costs of the default strategy. For example, trustees should consider an appropriate balance between the frequency of rebalancing, which incurs trading costs, and the efficient delivery of the long-term strategy objective. They should seek to achieve equity between active and deferred member-borne costs and charges and to satisfy themselves that all costs are competitive.
Depending on the type of default strategy selected, execution of some key components may need to be delegated to a third party. For example, in a ‘lifestyle’ strategy, switches between the funds underlying the strategy will usually be carried out mechanically by the scheme administrator. In such circumstances, trustees should satisfy themselves that the third party has the capability and is suitably qualified to execute the trustees’ requirements competently.
Trustees may also delegate some investment decisions in relation to the default strategy to an investment manager. For example, in a target maturity fund, a manager may be given discretion over the timing of changes in the mix of assets within the fund in order to mitigate member-borne risks in the run up to retirement. In such circumstances, trustees need to satisfy themselves that the investment manager is appropriately qualified to manage such a fund.
Trustees should satisfy themselves that their advisers are suitably qualified and capable of giving clear and practical advice. This will enable the trustee board to fully understand the options open to them in setting a default strategy and in delegating functions as necessary to ensure the effectiveness of their strategy. Trustees will need to be clear about what they are delegating and how they will monitor the effectiveness of delegated functions.
Trustees are not responsible for any act or default of any fund manager in the exercise of any relevant delegated discretion about investments as long as they have made sure that they have taken all reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the fund managers:
have the appropriate knowledge and experience to manage the scheme investments
carry out their work competently and in line with the trustees’ policy for choosing investments[32].
Selecting investment funds
Trustees need to select investment funds for the default strategy and, if appropriate for the scheme membership, further investment fund options for members who may wish to set their own strategy.
Trustees should devote sufficient time and resources to the following:
Understand the objective of each investment fund. In particular trustees should understand the:
asset classes being invested in, for example equities and fixed interest
level of risk both in the strategy for each fund and in the underlying investments, for example levels of volatility for each asset class
objective and investment style of the investment manager, for example to replicate or outperform an index and the net of expenses target return, for example to match a cash or inflation benchmark.
Understand the basis upon which the total level of costs and charges is calculated and levied on the fund, for example the extent of annual management charges and other ongoing costs and charges which impact on the value of member accounts.
Ensure the above information is documented so that it can be used to assess the performance of the funds is in line with objectives and continues to remain suitable for members.
Ensure that the fund information provided to members and the employer is accurate and reflects the risk rating and investment objectives of the funds. Whilst trustees will want to ensure that members have the information that they require to make informed decisions, trustees should be careful not to give advice to members.
Ensure that the number and risk profile of investment funds offered as an alternative to the default strategy reflects the needs of the membership. When considering the nature of investment choices available to members, trustees should ensure that investments are suitably labelled so members understand the risk profile of investment options.
As with the design of the default strategy, trustees should retain appropriately qualified advisers who can provide them with professional advice and assistance. Trustees should also ensure that they, or their advisers, obtain sufficient information from their investment managers to be satisfied that they can demonstrate that they have understood all the above matters and have factored them into their solution and their range of funds.
Where a scheme’s rules allow trustees to delegate investment decisions to an investment sub-committee, this can ensure that sufficient time and focus is given to particularly important and complex investment issues. However, all trustees (not just those on the relevant sub-committee) still remain responsible for all decisions made and actions taken by sub-committees.
The investment considerations of a member with a DB pension, supported by AVCs, may be different from a member who is relying solely on a DC pension. Trustees should take a pragmatic approach in these situations.
Security and liquidity of scheme assets
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
predominantly invest in assets admitted to trading on regulated markets. Where unregulated investment options are offered, it must be demonstrable why it was appropriate to offer those investment options
understand the levels of financial protection available to members and carefully consider situations where compensation is not available
understand and put arrangements in place to mitigate the impact to members of business and/or commercial risks
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees must exercise their investment powers in a way which ensures the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole[33]. The regulations cover a range of issues together. The section below focuses on the security and liquidity of the portfolio as a whole.
Trustees must make sure that the scheme assets are invested predominantly in regulated markets[34].
Practical guidance to help trustees[35]
Trustees must give due consideration to asset protection and understand what would happen in the event of a problem[36].
This is a complex area and trustees may need to seek independent advice to determine the extent to which, if at all, situations exist in which any loss caused by misfeasance in relation to the scheme’s assets, or due to insolvency or default, might be covered by a compensation scheme or indemnity insurance. For example, trustees should establish whether contractual arrangements with investment platform providers include an indemnity clause in the event of default.
Trustees should understand the protection relating to assets held overseas either directly or through an investment fund. It may not always be possible to obtain an appropriate and enforceable financial guarantee, particularly in the context of pooled mandates. If no guarantee is available, trustees should consider the extent to which (if any) compensation arrangements and other methods of recourse are available to them if an investment provider defaults and scheme assets are lost or dissipated (other than through exposure to market risk in accordance with the set investment mandates of the fund).
Trustees need to understand the characteristics of complex investment instruments and investment strategies. They should put arrangements in place to ensure that members are suitably safeguarded against loss or misappropriation of assets. They should also consider such things as counterparty risk and the creditworthiness of institutions which hold the scheme’s or a particular investment fund’s cash positions.
Trustees should ensure that the levels and nature of financial protection or compensation available to members is clearly communicated to members and employers. When protection changes, this should also be communicated.
Trustees should establish whether:
the investment funds and products offered to members are regulated, for example by the Financial Conduct Authority or similar regulatory authority in the case of overseas jurisdictions
the investment funds and products qualify for protection and compensation, for example under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
members would qualify for protection and have a claim as a result of the trustee(s) being an eligible claimant.
Trustees should make sure that this information is communicated to members. If trustees decide to offer investments or products which are not regulated by a relevant body they should:
undertake additional due diligence checks on the investment to understand the regulation, compensation arrangements, governance and controls in place, and the risk factors to which members will be exposed
document why they have chosen these investments and why they are suitable for the membership.
Where the trustees consider that adequate protection does not exist they should consider how appropriate it is to hold the asset. If they decide to retain it, trustees should consider what mitigation they can put in place, for example insurance, financial guarantees or changes to contractual terms.
Trustees should consider the liquidity of assets held in the funds underpinning the default strategy and other funds offered to members. When a fund holds illiquid assets, it may be necessary for the fund to restrict dealing frequency. This needs to be taken into account as it may result in delays in investing contributions or rebalancing the default strategy. The out-of-market risk (ie the risk that the member faces of not having market exposure for a period of time) and the risk of being imbalanced to target as the result of such delays needs to be balanced carefully with the potential investment return premium to be gained from holding illiquid assets.

Monitoring and reviewing the default strategy
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
monitor the ongoing suitability of the default strategy for the membership.
Legal requirements
Trustees must regularly monitor and review their scheme’s investment strategy[37].
Practical guidance to help trustees[38]
Trustees should take time to monitor and review the appropriateness of the default strategy.
Certain events may trigger a review of the default strategy such as:
a merger with another organisation which results in a change in the demographics of the scheme membership
a change in ownership or personnel of the investment managers
sustained changes in market conditions.
When reviewing and monitoring the default strategy, trustees should consider its suitability taking into account innovations in DC investment products, changes in regulatory requirements, the demographics of the scheme membership and innovations in the decumulation market. The review should take into account the needs of both active and deferred members. Investment and risk monitoring may help trustees to identify other potential risks. This analysis, coupled with demographic reports, helps trustees to decide whether the risk and maturity profile of the scheme membership is adequately addressed by the default strategy.
Reviewing investment fund performance
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
ensure that arrangements are established to review the ongoing appropriateness of investment options
ensure that the performance of each investment option, including the default strategy, is regularly assessed against stated investment objectives
monitor the ongoing suitability of the default strategy for the membership.
Legal requirements
Trustees must regularly monitor and review the investment options that members can choose from and update their statement of investment principles accordingly[39].
Practical guidance to help trustees[40]
It is important that trustees monitor and review investment performance both for their default strategy’s underlying investment funds and for other investment funds they make available for members who set their own strategy.
Fund performance review triggers
Trustees should build flexibility into the review and assessment arrangements. The size and value of each investment fund should be a factor in considering the nature and frequency of review. Trustees should pay particular and more frequent attention to investment funds that hold a significant proportion of scheme members’ assets, for example the investment funds which underpin the default strategy.
The types of investment funds selected by members may also trigger a review. For example, trustees may decide to select a higher-risk investment fund to review on the basis that it is more volatile, regardless of the fact that it is likely to represent a smaller element of members’ portfolios.
Trustees may consider setting mechanical triggers based upon the performance of investment funds against their benchmarks but these triggers need to be appropriate to the type of fund and its objective. For example, an index-tracking fund may merit triggers which are configured tightly around the index return. However, an actively managed fund holding volatile assets may merit triggers configured more loosely around its long-term performance objective.
In all cases, trustees should set triggers which are appropriate to the long-term nature of pension scheme investments and should not take decisions based upon short-term performance.
Form of review
The review may take different forms, for example based on manager or adviser reports, or involve meetings with the managers or advisers.
When reviewing and monitoring fund performance, trustees should:
assess the performance of each investment fund against stated performance objectives
compare investment returns to industry benchmarks
consider the impact of fees on the investment return as it is the net return which members receive: the level of fees should be checked against appropriate market comparators to ensure they remain competitive
monitor the levels of portfolio turnover and consider whether these are justifiable in light of investment objectives and whether this results in unnecessary costs for members
ensure that controls (including those related to the security, liquidity and safe custody of scheme assets) are in place to alert them to potential risks
regularly assess the effectiveness of the investment decision-making and governance process, make improvements to the process as appropriate and report to interested parties (including members).
Changing investment funds
Where trustees decide to make a change of investment funds or investment manager, they must consider the transition options available and decide which is most suitable for the scheme[41]. They should ensure that there are controls around the transfer process to mitigate out-of-market risks and transition costs. Some common mitigations include:
in specie transfers where the assets are simply reregistered rather than traded
pre-funding which crystallises the cost of transfer and creates certainty
undertaking phased selling to reduce volatility
ensuring that the transfer of investments and cash between the parties is reconciled after transition.
Trustees should consider if any guarantees or other favourable treatment might be lost on transition and if there are any penalties which will be triggered.
Members should be informed in advance of the transfer so they can switch to a different fund if they do not want their investments to be automatically moved to the new fund. Most transitions will also result in a black-out period when members will be unable to view or alter their accounts and this should be communicated to members.
However, member communications should not delay a transfer that needs to happen urgently to protect member investments, for example due to a risk of provider insolvency. In those circumstances, communications should happen as soon as practicable after the transition.
Documenting reviews of investment strategy and fund performance
Trustees should document the arrangements for all reviews of the default strategy and investment fund options. This should include factors considered, decisions made and actions taken. If the trustees conclude that it would be inappropriate to make any changes suggested by the review, they should fully document the reasons for not making those changes.
Investment decision-making and trustee knowledge
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
understand their duties and be fit and proper to carry them out
establish and maintain procedures and controls to ensure the effectiveness and performance of the services offered by scheme advisers and service providers.
Legal requirements
Investment decisions must be taken in the light of appropriate advice from professional advisers such as the scheme’s investment consultants[42].
Practical guidance to help trustees[43]
Trustees’ own knowledge
Trustees must have a good working knowledge of investment matters relating to their scheme[44]. As a starting point, trustees should understand the characteristics of the asset classes, the key differences between those asset classes, their volatility and risks. They should also understand the nature of the investment products through which the scheme gains exposure to assets, for example whether the funds are constituted as life funds or open ended investment companies.
Acting in the best interests of members and beneficiaries
DC quality features
In a quality scheme, trustees will:
act in the best interests of all beneficiaries.
Legal requirements
Trustees must exercise their investment powers in the interests of members and beneficiaries[45]. They also have a more general duty to act in the best interests of beneficiaries.
In acting in the best interests of members and beneficiaries, trustees should take financial interests into account. They must also set out in their statement of investment principles the extent (if at all) to which they have considered issues such as socially responsible investment (for example social, environmental and governance factors) that may affect the long-term performance of investments[46].
If trustees face a potential conflict of interest, they must invest the assets in the sole interests of members and beneficiaries[47].
Where a conflict exists, the trustees should be able to demonstrate that they effectively manage the conflict. They should take appropriate advice and make a reasonable and prudent decision based on the information available at the time.
Practical guidance to help trustees[48]
When considering the suitability of investments, trustees should take into account environmental and social factors which may impact on longer term returns.
When determining whether or not the investment options are socially responsible, trustees may also want to give consideration to ethical issues which may impact on their beneficiaries.
Trustees need to be confident that outsourcing stewardship functions is carried out with the best interests of beneficiaries in mind. While primarily an issue for schemes investing in equity holdings (for example UK listed companies), trustees may want to determine whether a stewardship approach is appropriate for other asset classes.
For example, trustees may want to determine whether and how investment managers are exercising ownership rights. This includes monitoring and engaging with companies on matters such as strategy, performance, risk, capital structure and corporate governance.
More information on quality engagement between institutional investors and investee companies is available in the UK Stewardship Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council[49].

About the Independent Monitoring Board
Inside every prison, immigration removal centre and some short term holding facilities at airports, there is an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) – a group of ordinary members of the public doing an extraordinary job.
IMB members are independent, unpaid and work an average of 2-3 days per month. Their role is to monitor the day-to-day life in their local prison or removal centre and ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained.
Members have unrestricted access to their local prison or immigration detention centre at any time and can talk to any prisoner or detainee they wish to, out of sight and hearing of a members of staff if necessary. A typical monitoring visit, for example, might include time spent in the kitchens, workshops, accommodation blocks, recreation areas, healthcare centre and chaplaincy.
Board members also play an important role in dealing with problems inside the establishment. If a prisoner or detainee has an issue that he or she has been unable to resolve through the usual internal channels, he or she can put in a confidential request to see a member of the IMB. Problems might include concerns over lost property, visits from family or friends, special religious or cultural requirements, or even serious allegations such as bullying.
If something serious happens at the establishment, for example a riot or a death in custody, representatives of the board may be called in to attend and observe the way in which the situation is handled.

Workplace pensions. We're all in. The Pensions Regulator
Are you an employer?
Workplace pensions are here. Act now. It's the law.
Even if you employ just one person, you must provide a workplace pension.
The law requires all employers to provide a workplace pension for certain staff. Find out how the change in law will affect you.
What is automatic enrolment?
The law on workplace pensions has changed. Every employer with at least one member of staff now has new duties, including putting those who meet certain criteria into a workplace pension scheme and contributing towards it.
This is called automatic enrolment. It’s called this because it’s automatic for your staff – they don’t have to do anything to be enrolled into your pension scheme. But it’s not automatic for you. You need to take steps to make sure they’re enrolled.
Does the change in law affect me?
Yes, if you employ at least one member of staff, you’ll need to automatically enrol them into a pension scheme if they meet certain criteria. Get started by reading our essential guide to automatic enrolment .
View the essential guide to automatic enrolment
When will the change in law affect me?
Each employer has a date by which they need to comply with the law. This is called your staging date. Find out yours now with our staging date tool .
Find out your staging date
What do I need to do and by when?
There are a number of tasks that will need to be completed by your staging date, including assessing your workforce to see who’s eligible, choosing a pension scheme, and communicating to staff. To help you prepare use our automatic enrolment action planner to find out what you need to do and by when.

How do I nominate a contact?
You need to tell us who’ll be responsible for managing the automatic enrolment process by nominating a contact. Over the coming months, we'll send help and guidance to this person.

Pension scams
Pension scams are on the increase in the UK. Check the facts before you make an irreversible decision. A lifetime's savings can be lost in a moment.
What's a pension scam?
Pension scams are enticing savers by claiming to help them access their pension before age 55 or that people can already take more than 25% of their pension as cash. For most people the offers will be bogus and victims will lose most, if not all, of their savings.
Only in rare cases – like terminal illness – can pension scheme members take their pension before age 55. It remains the law that pension scheme members can only take up to 25% of their pension savings as a cash lump sum. Although this may change in the future it's important that members aren't fooled into thinking that is the law today.
Pension scheme members who agree to transfer may lose all their savings and may still be subject to tax charges of over half their transfer value for taking an 'unauthorised payment'.

Ensure your DB scheme is run and funded effectively
Our revised defined benefit (DB) code has now come into force. You should use the code to ensure your DB pension scheme is run and funded effectively in order to meet its promises.
The code emphasises the importance of trustees and employers working together to strike a balance which supports both the scheme's aim to provide pensions for members and the employer's need to invest in sustainable business growth. It also focuses on taking an integrated approach to managing the main risks that influence a scheme’s chances of paying its benefits in full.
Trustees, employers and professionals from the wider pension community should familiarise themselves with the revised code to ensure that it’s implemented in a balanced way for their scheme.
If you’re currently undertaking a scheme valuation you should consider whether it’s in line with the principles of the updated code.
Trustees
You should work openly and transparently with the sponsoring employer to ensure your scheme is run and funded effectively. In order to have the best chance to be in a position to pay members' benefits, you will need to manage risks to the scheme and understand how they affect each other.

Automatic enrolment
Top five automatic enrolment questions - more automatic enrolment questions
As an employer, when will automatic enrolment apply to me?
The employer duties are being staged in over six years and the date you’ll need to begin the process of automatic enrolment is known as your staging date. Staging dates are based on the number of people in an employer's largest PAYE scheme. The number of people is based on the latest information available to the regulator from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) as at 1 April 2012.
If you’re an employer using only one PAYE scheme, you can use our interactive tool to find out your staging date . For all other cases, you may need to carry out a further check to ensure you have the correct staging date. If you have multiple PAYEs, you need to input all your PAYE references into the tool and the earliest staging date given will be the one that applies.
It remains the responsibility of employers to ensure they’ve determined the correct staging date for their organisation. You should therefore ensure you enter the correct PAYE reference and be aware that there may be other circumstances that could affect your staging date, eg if you share a PAYE scheme with a larger organisation.
What is our letter code and where can I find it?
Your letter code is a 10-digit reference, which you can find on any letters we’ve sent you about automatic enrolment so far. You’ll need this when you come to complete your declaration of compliance (registration) or if you wish to bring your staging date forward.
Can an eligible member of staff opt out before being automatically enrolled?
No. An eligible member of staff must be automatically enrolled before they can opt out of pension scheme membership as provided for in the legislation.
Automatic enrolment is achieved when an employer has given information about the eligible staff to the pension scheme, and the eligible member of staff has received the enrolment information from their employer and has become an active member of the pension scheme.
For more information, please see opting out .
Do we have to notify the regulator that we will be using postponement from our staging date?
No, you don’t have to notify us if you intend to use postponement. However, you’ll be asked what your latest deferral date was when you complete your declaration of compliance with The Pensions Regulator following your staging date.
It’s important to note that, if you do apply postponement to a member of staff or a group of staff, you must issue them with postponement notices.
Find our more information about postponement .
How much will I have to pay?
The contribution level is being phased in during implementation, increasing gradually to help employers adjust to costs. Over time, all members of staff must receive minimum pension contributions of 8%, with at least 3% coming from you, the employer. You and/or your staff can pay more than the minimum, see contributions and funding .

Simplifying the law of kidnapping and child abduction
Over 300 children are unlawfully retained overseas every year. In our latest report we recommend reforms that will clarify the offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment, and allow for the prosecution of parents who keep their children overseas in contravention of a court order or without permission of the other parent.
We are recommending that the existing common Law offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment should be replaced with two new statutory offences. False imprisonment will be replaced by unlawful detention, and kidnapping will become a statutory offence based on the use or threat of force to take or move the victim.  The new offences will continue to capture the range of criminal conduct covered by the existing law.
The reforms we are recommending in relation to child abduction are designed to solve two problems with the current law:
•   The seven-year maximum sentence for child abduction has been considered too limited in some extreme cases. We believe the maximum sentence should be increased to 14 years.
•   To fill a gap in the current law, we are recommending that the child abduction offence be extended to those cases where a child is lawfully removed from the UK, but then unlawfully retained abroad.
Professor David Ormerod QC, Law Commissioner for criminal law, said: “The wrongful separation of a child from its parent can have a devastating effect on all involved. An opportunity exists to introduce reforms that will modernise and simplify this area of law, and allow the courts to deal adequately and appropriately with offenders.”
Code in force: September 2013
Guidance available with this code

Create your action plan for automatic enrolment
This planner has been designed to help you identify what you'll need to do to prepare for automatic enrolment.
Any employer preparing for automatic enrolment should find it helpful, but it’s of particular relevance to you if:
you employ up to 249 staff
every member of staff is based in the UK
you have one Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme
you have or are planning to set up a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme.
Create your action plan
Allow plenty of time to prepare for automatic enrolment. We recommend starting 12 months before your staging date, though this will vary depending on your individual circumstances – not all employers will need to allow so much time.
Step 1
Find out your staging date
To create your action plan, you'll need your staging date. You can find it by entering your PAYE reference into our staging date tool. Even if you think you know it already, it's a good idea to double-check it prior to creating your plan.

The Pensions Regulator is the UK regulator of work-based pension schemes. We work with trustees, employers, pension specialists and business advisers, giving guidance on what is expected of them.
We also have functions under legislation passed in 2008 and a statutory objective to maximise compliance with the employer duties under that legislation relating to automatic enrolment.
Our principal aim is to prevent problems from developing. We use our powers flexibly, reasonably and appropriately, with the aim of putting things right and keeping schemes, and employers on the right track for the long term.
Workplace pensions law has changed and every employer must comply. Find out more .

How we regulate and enforce
The regulatory powers now available to The Pensions Regulator enable us to be more effective at dealing with risks to pension schemes and members' benefits, and to tackle these risks in a focused, targeted and proportionate manner.

B
back end loading
An arrangement between trustees and employer allowing the employer to make good a deficit by paying the extra contributions needed in unequal instalments. The early instalments will be smaller than the later ones. This expression is used in relation to the recovery plan.
Barber judgement
The European Court judgement which established that men and women should be treated equally in relation to their pensions. The judgement was handed down on 17 May 1990 and this became the reference date for all changes to scheme benefit rules to comply with the ruling.
Despite this, state benefits remain unequal and will remain so for many years to come and this creates difficulties for schemes with GMPs in relation to equalisation.
Barber window
The time period which elapsed between the Barber judgement in the European Court (17 May 1990) and the date on which the scheme complied (or is due to comply) with the ruling that scheme benefits should be equalised between men and women.
basic state pension
The flat rate (not earnings related) state pension paid to all who have met the minimum NI contribution requirements, their spouses, subject to certain conditions, and widow(er)s.
bear market
A market in which equity prices are falling and sellers are more predominant than buyers. It is the opposite of a bull market, in which prices are rising and there are more buyers than sellers.
benchmark
A measure against which fund management performance is to be judged. A series of appropriate indices is chosen which reflects the requirements of the trustees. Usually a target is set which requires an agreed percentage better performance from the fund manager than the benchmark.
beneficiary
A member of a pension scheme who is entitled to a benefit from the scheme or a dependant who will become entitled on the death of the member.
benefit schedule
A schedule prepared by the administrators listing all scheme members (including dependants in receipt of benefits), and the benefits to which they are entitled. Usually drawn up when the administration is changing hands (eg when a scheme is being transferred to the PPF).
benefits
Any payments made to a beneficiary, including tax-free lump sums, pension payments and death benefits.
benefits consultant
Benefits consultants advise on remuneration and pension benefits. They may be retained by the employer or the trustees or both. They may be scheme actuaries.
benefits statement
A statement or estimate of benefits payable in respect of an individual's membership of a pension scheme, eg annually during employment, on retirement, in the event of wind up.
beta
Returns on a portfolio which can be attributed to movements in the market as a whole, rather than the skills of a particular fund manager. Usually achieved by holding a portfolio which exactly mirrors a particular index, eg the FTSE 350.
See also: alpha .
bonds
Loans made to an issuer (often the Government or a company) which undertakes to repay the loan at an agreed later date.
The term refers generically to corporate bonds or government bonds (gilts). However, in common parlance, the term bond is more likely to be used with reference to a corporate bond, while the term gilt refers exclusively to government investments, including index-linked gilts.
BR19
The form submitted by an individual to the Benefits Agency requesting a statement, estimating their state pension entitlement. It can be submitted up to four months before retirement age.
breach of trust
Any act or omission on the part of the trustee that is inconsistent with the terms of the trust agreement or the law of trusts.
bull market
A market in which equity prices are rising and buyers are more predominant than sellers. It is the opposite of a bear market, in which prices are falling and there are more sellers than buyers
buy-out
The purchase of an annuity for each member of a scheme which will guarantee pension benefits as nearly as possible equal to those which would otherwise be paid by the scheme.
buy-out debt
The amount of money required to purchase life assurance annuities for each member of a scheme which will guarantee pension benefits equal to those which would otherwise be paid by the scheme.
This may also be referred to as the 'section 75 debt' or 'debt on the employer'.
C
call option
A contract with a bank which is paid for up front and which will allow the investor to buy certain specified assets at an agreed price at some time in the future, even if the market value of those assets at that time is more than that agreed price.
capital markets
The markets in which capital is raised initially through the issue of shares (equities) and loans (bonds) and then subsequently traded. The stock market (dealing with the trading of equities) forms a significant, but by no means only, part of the capital market.
cash balance scheme
A type of scheme in which a percentage of salary is set aside each year for each member. The employer undertakes to ensure that each annual contribution will grow by a specified amount which is linked to prevailing interest rates. At retirement, the member's minimum accumulated fund will be determined by the specified minimum rate of growth for each contribution. It may bear no relation to levels of pay and it may be considerably higher than the minimum, if investments have been successful.
cash flow
The amount of actual money being received and spent. In the case of a pension scheme, the amount of money being received into the scheme in contributions and investment returns and the amount of money being paid out by the scheme.
In common parlance, in the case of DB schemes, projected cash flows usually refer to cash required in the future by the trustees to pay for pension liabilities when they fall due.
closed scheme
A pension scheme which does not admit new members. Contributions may or may not continue and benefits may or may not be provided for future service.
codes of practice
The Pensions Regulator's codes of practice give practical information about how trustees can comply with legal requirements, and set out the standards of conduct and practice expected.
combined code
The combined code on corporate governance sets out standards of good practice in relation to issues such as board composition and development, remuneration, accountability and audit and relations with shareholders. The code was devised and is maintained by the Financial Reporting Council.
See also: listing rules .
commutation factors

Companies House
An executive agency of the department for business, enterprise and regulatory reform (BERR), which examines and stores company information delivered under the Companies Act and related legislation and makes this information available to the public on request. This includes annual financial statements from every limited company, whether or not it is quoted on any exchange.
compromise agreement
A legal agreement, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of the debt due from a sponsoring employer to a scheme under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Where a compromise agreement has been reached, a scheme will not usually be eligible for PPF compensation, unless the PPF agreed to the compromise at the time it was made.
conflicts of interest
A conflict, for example, between:
a trustee's interest as an employee, eg financial director, and his or her duty as a trustee
the duty of a professional to the employer as well as to the trustees, where they are acting for both
contingent assets
Assets which are owned by the employer and which may be offered as security to the trustees of a pension scheme in deficit, where the employer covenant is weak and where the contribution required is not acceptable to the employer.

Viewing CSV files on our site
CSV (Comma-Separated-Value) is a common file type used to import data from one software application to another, with commas separating the values in each field.
This file format allows for data to be easily retrieved into a variety of applications, they are best viewed within one that will allow the easy manipulation of data that is displayed in columns. Common examples of such applications are those that are used to create spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel or Open Office Calc.
If you don't have access to a suitable application, you can also view:
the data in either an ASCII text-editor or a word-processor. However, since neither of these application types has the facility to easily format the width of the data columns, quite a bit of manual reformatting may be required to view the files properly.
the file in your browser, or you may want to download the file by 'right-clicking' on the link and save the file to your computer.
Some people may find that when they view the CSV file some information may not be correctly displayed. For example, you may see:
rows of 'hash' symbols eg '######' instead of numbers or letters, this is because the current column is too narrow, try double clicking the column header
some information displayed in 'scientific notation' eg '1.23 x 109' instead of '1230000000', this is remedied by setting the column format to 'number' rather than 'general' or 'scientific'.

Theatre workers take centre stage in latest automatic enrolment landmark
Ref: PN14-46
Thursday 11 December 2014
More than five million workers have been automatically enrolled into a workplace pension scheme, The Pensions Regulator has revealed today.
The five millionth worker to join the cast of those automatically enrolled into a workplace pension works for Rose Theatre Kingston, Surrey.
This month’s automatic enrolment declaration of compliance report shows that more than 42,700 employers of all types from charities to supermarkets, football clubs and decorators have now automatically enrolled their workers.
Siobhan Sharp, 23, Marketing Officer at the theatre said: “I work behind the scenes on productions for the Rose so it makes a change for me to be centre stage having been automatically enrolled into a workplace pension.
“I wasn’t saving towards a pension before, so knowing I’m saving for my future is a good thing and brings me peace of mind.”
The first workers were automatically enrolled into pension schemes in 2012 starting with the largest employers and the duties will extend to the smallest firms and new employers by 2018. The policy was introduced to address under-saving with millions not putting aside enough for retirement, and only 1 in 3 private sector workers paying into a workplace pension.
Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: “Our pension reforms are helping people save towards a secure and comfortable future in their retirement. The number of people saving into their workplace pension was chronically low. We are changing that so participating in a workplace pension scheme provided by your employer is no longer a rarity, but becomes the norm.”
The Pensions Regulator’s Executive Director for Automatic Enrolment Charles Counsell said: “Automatic enrolment affects every employer with workers in the UK. It’s automatic for staff – they don’t have to do anything. But it’s not automatic for employers: they need to take steps to make sure certain workers are enrolled.
“More than 43,000 employers have automatically enrolled their staff into a pension and nearly half of them said they wished they had left more time as it took them longer than they thought. We encourage all employers, however small, to learn from the experience of other employers – leaving extra time is better than leaving it too late.”
Editor's notes
The Pensions Regulator is the regulator of work-based pension schemes in the UK. We have objectives to: protect members’ benefits; reduce the risk of calls on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF); to promote, and to improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes; to maximise employer compliance with automatic enrolment duties; and to minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of an employer (in relation to the exercise of the regulator’s functions under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 only).
A monthly report on the number of employers who have completed their declaration of compliance is published on our website . All employers must declare their compliance to The Pensions Regulator after automatically enrolling their staff.
Eventually up to 1.3 million employers will have automatically enrolled up to 10 million eligible workers into a workplace pension scheme.
Rose Theatre Kingston employs 101 people. It produces its own productions as well as hosting work from theatre companies including the Royal Shakespeare Company and the English Touring Theatre in its 900-seat auditorium.
Press contacts
Workplace pensions. We're all in. The Pensions Regulator
Are you an employer?
Workplace pensions are here. Act now. It's the law.
Even if you employ just one person, you must provide a workplace pension.
The law requires all employers to provide a workplace pension for certain staff. Find out how the change in law will affect you.
What is automatic enrolment?
The law on workplace pensions has changed. Every employer with at least one member of staff now has new duties, including putting those who meet certain criteria into a workplace pension scheme and contributing towards it.
This is called automatic enrolment. It’s called this because it’s automatic for your staff – they don’t have to do anything to be enrolled into your pension scheme. But it’s not automatic for you. You need to take steps to make sure they’re enrolled.
Does the change in law affect me?
Yes, if you employ at least one member of staff, you’ll need to automatically enrol them into a pension scheme if they meet certain criteria. Get started by reading our essential guide to automatic enrolment .
View the essential guide to automatic enrolment
When will the change in law affect me?
Each employer has a date by which they need to comply with the law. This is called your staging date. Find out yours now with our staging date tool .
Find out your staging date
What do I need to do and by when?
There are a number of tasks that will need to be completed by your staging date, including assessing your workforce to see who’s eligible, choosing a pension scheme, and communicating to staff. To help you prepare use our automatic enrolment action planner to find out what you need to do and by when.
Create my action plan
How do I nominate a contact?
You need to tell us who’ll be responsible for managing the automatic enrolment process by nominating a contact. Over the coming months, we'll send help and guidance to this person.
Nominate a contact
What if I'm not an employer?
If you’re a member of staff, not an employer, check if automatic enrolment applies to you .

Complete and accurate record-keeping: your role
Trustees and administrators have a vital role to play in ensuring defined contribution (DC) pension schemes have complete and accurate records.
Good quality member data
Record-keeping is at the heart of a good quality pension scheme. Poor data can have a major impact on members and cost a lot of time and money to fix.
Having complete and accurate member data forms a part of the 31 quality features that we expect to see in well-managed DC schemes.
Record-keeping continues to be one of our main areas of focus. We have recently opened a number of cases into schemes where we needed to investigate further their standards of record-keeping.
Trustees and administrators need to work together effectively to ensure that schemes have complete and accurate member data that is reviewed regularly.
Trustees
Even if you outsource the management of your scheme data to an administrator, you are responsible for the quality of that data.
For good practice tips, including working effectively with an administrator, read our quick guide to record-keeping:

Ensure your DB scheme is run and funded effectively
Our revised defined benefit (DB) code has now come into force. You should use the code to ensure your DB pension scheme is run and funded effectively in order to meet its promises.
The code emphasises the importance of trustees and employers working together to strike a balance which supports both the scheme's aim to provide pensions for members and the employer's need to invest in sustainable business growth. It also focuses on taking an integrated approach to managing the main risks that influence a scheme’s chances of paying its benefits in full.
Trustees, employers and professionals from the wider pension community should familiarise themselves with the revised code to ensure that it’s implemented in a balanced way for their scheme.
If you’re currently undertaking a scheme valuation you should consider whether it’s in line with the principles of the updated code.
Trustees
You should work openly and transparently with the sponsoring employer to ensure your scheme is run and funded effectively. In order to have the best chance to be in a position to pay members' benefits, you will need to manage risks to the scheme and understand how they affect each other.

Pension scams
Pension scams are on the increase in the UK. Check the facts before you make an irreversible decision. A lifetime's savings can be lost in a moment.
What's a pension scam?
Pension scams are enticing savers by claiming to help them access their pension before age 55 or that people can already take more than 25% of their pension as cash. For most people the offers will be bogus and victims will lose most, if not all, of their savings.
Only in rare cases – like terminal illness – can pension scheme members take their pension before age 55. It remains the law that pension scheme members can only take up to 25% of their pension savings as a cash lump sum. Although this may change in the future it's important that members aren't fooled into thinking that is the law today.
Pension scheme members who agree to transfer may lose all their savings and may still be subject to tax charges of over half their transfer value for taking an 'unauthorised payment'.

Primary Authority
Businesses should be able to rely on the environmental health, licensing and trading standards advice received from local authorities, in the knowledge that it is expert opinion, applicable across the UK, and a secure basis for investment and operational decisions.
Primary Authority gives companies the right to form a statutory partnership with a single local authority, which then provides robust and reliable advice for other councils to take into account when carrying out inspections or dealing with non-compliance. It is the gateway to simpler, more successful local regulation.
It is the most effective means for councils to deliver support to businesses, through impact partnerships.
It can increase the prosperity of communities.
It can offer protection for vulnerable consumers and traders facing unfair competition.
Primary Authority was launched on 6 April 2009. Its operation is a statutory responsibility of LBRO. Our role is to register partnerships, issue guidance and resolve disputes.

Professional Competency
An ongoing collaborative project is introducing common regulatory competence standards for the professionals undertaking local regulation. The work is being led by LBRO in partnership with the World Class Coalition, which comprises 18 professional and representative bodies, including national regulators. The overall approach to competency is closely linked with the relevant qualifications frameworks provided by the professional bodies - including the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Trading Standards Institute - and supported by the key players in the local and national regulatory landscape, giving transparency and confidence to all.
The first competency frameworks were launched in November 2011 and continue to evolve, shaped by users and stakeholders. The aim is to ensure that the development needs of regulators in local authorities and elsewhere are identified and addressed:
through self-assessment;
via simple, flexible and user friendly web-based tools that can be used in conjunction with existing approaches;
with access to innovative and cost-effective solutions for meeting development needs; and
as an integral part of continuous professional development.
The overall approach to competency has already proved rigorous and flexible. It has been used successfully since 2009 by the Health and Safety Executive and health and safety regulators at most local authorities in Great Britain. Its key features are:
core, generic regulatory skills and leadership skills sections;
technical knowledge sections, specific to areas of regulation;
the Guidance for Regulators - Information Point (GRIP) , designed to help meet development needs identified; and
a development process for regulators and managers.

Outcomes and Impacts Pathways
Delivering Sustainable Outcomes
Given the challenging financial climate, clarity about outcomes and longer-term impacts is key to the most effective targeting of limited resources to support business prosperity and consumer protection. RAND Europe conducted a rigorous investigation of this issue in relation to regulatory services. This involved the creation of an evaluation matrix to assess the impacts of activities and the study of five different areas of work: fair trading, fly-tipping, health and safety, reduction of alcohol harm, and smoking cessation.
A subsequent report, published in October 2009, gave regulatory services a process for building a robust evidence base to clarify and quantify the benefits their activities deliver to local businesses and consumers. The core of this publication was a step by step guide to the development of meaningful indicators to assess the outcomes and impacts of operations, drawing on visual representations called pathways. The use of this toolkit is helping many regulatory services to have more informed discussions about priorities and the allocation of resources, as well as increasing general awareness of their initiatives - enhancing their profile in local strategic partnerships.
The concise version of the toolkit provided below covers all the essentials and includes a worked example from East Cambridgeshire District Council. The 13 key tools it lists are closely linked, and should be applied in sequence to gain their full value, as the elements of a comprehensive evaluation framework.
Excellence Framework
Responsiveness to Customers and Stakeholders
Greater understanding between regulatory services and the businesses they monitor brings benefits for both parties. This removes cultural barriers to communication, strengthens working relationships, encourages mutual trust and promotes a partnership approach to achieving compliance.
Officers now have the opportunity to step into their customers’ commercial shoes via Trading Places. Study visits arranged at UK companies of all sizes offer great practical learning experiences, plus valuable insight into how businesses are run and the challenges they can face. Shared learning is encouraged by bringing together people from the private and public sectors, with the involvement of national regulators.
Trading Places is open to all environmental health, fire safety, licensing and trading standards officers working in local authorities, as well as businesses from any sector. It is free and carries CPD points. It was launched in March 2009 after extensive testing and evaluation, and is endorsed by the CBI, the FSB, the British Chambers of Commerce, the British Retail Consortium, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Trading Standards Institute.
The following links lead to an overview of Trading Places, two podcasts in which local authority and business representatives discuss why they support the initiative, the list of forthcoming business placements, and the registration forms. Please complete the relevant one to participate.
Better Regulation Principles
Excellence Framework
Consensus about the core aspects of effective regulatory services is provided by the Excellence Framework developed with LGR and local authorities through the world class coalition. Its value derives from the fact that it is the product of agreement, both nationally and locally. Rigorous, thorough and practical, it covers service delivery in its entirety, reflects the views and experiences of practitioners, and is based on recognized standards. It enables regulatory services to maximize their contribution to the outcomes that matter for businesses and citizens. It is designed to help regulatory services assess where they are now, where they are going, whether the direction of travel if appropriate, and what areas need to be improved.

Proposals for the reform of legal aid in England and Wales: Ministry of Justice consultation paper CP12/10 - Response of the official solicitor to the senior courts (PDF 0.30mb)
The Official Solicitor and the Public Trustee are independent statutory office holders. Their office (OSPT) is an arms length body of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) that exists to support their work.  The Official Solicitor and the Public Trustee each have a number of separate functions, although their respective trusts, estates and deputyships are managed by the same team. The services they each provide can be best understood by reference to their respective statutory duties and functions.
The Official Solicitor, by providing front line services, provides access to the justice system to those who are vulnerable by virtue of minority or lack of mental capacity where that is needed.  In so doing the Official Solicitor mitigates
the disadvantage that his clients experience because of their disability or age.
the vulnerability of his clients to social exclusion.
The Official Solicitor and the Public Trustee provide last resort trustee, executorship and deputyship services.
The appointee to the office of the Official Solicitor to the Senior Courts is Alastair Pitblado; the appointee to the office of Public Trustee is Eddie Bloomfield.
There are around 135 staff, all of whom are civil servants. 22 are lawyers with the remaining staff specialising in particular areas of the work. About 40 of the staff are caseworkers, all of whom have access to in-house legal advice where appropriate, and some of whom have the conduct of cases under the direct supervision of the lawyers.
The working relationships between the Official Solicitor and the MoJ and the Public Trustee and the MoJ are set out in MOUs dated 08/01/2010 (PT/MoJ) and 05/05/2010 (OS/MoJ).
The Official Solicitor is appointed by the Lord Chancellor under section 90 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.  One of his purposes is to prevent injustice to the vulnerable by
acting as last resort litigation friend, and in some cases solicitor, for adults who lack mental capacity and children (other than those who are the subject of child welfare proceedings) in court proceedings because they lack decision making capacity in relation to the proceedings.
acting as last resort administrator of estates and trustee.
acting as last resort property and affairs deputy in relation to Court of Protection clients.
As an office holder of the Senior Courts he also
acts as advocate to the court providing advice and assistance to the court; and under Harbin v Masterman making enquiries on behalf of the court.
And he also
through the International Child Abduction and Contact Unit (ICACU) carries out in England and Wales the operational functions of the Lord Chancellor, who is the Central Authority under the Hague and European Conventions on Child Abduction.
through the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO) Unit carries out in England and Wales the operational functions of the Lord Chancellor who is the Central Authority for international maintenance claims.
is appointed, in place of a parent, to act as the registered contact in the administration of the Government’s Child Trust Fund scheme for those children in care in England and Wales when there is no other suitable person to do so.
However changes in procedures and law, now mean the Official Solicitor rarely takes action other than to remind those sent to prison for contempt of their right to apply to remove their contempt.
The Public Trustee is appointed under section 8 of the Public Trustee Act 1906. He acts as executor or administrator of estates and as the appointed trustee of settlements.
His aim is to provide an effective executor and trustee service of last resort.
In addition the Public Trustee
(a) is the legal holder of land under Part IV of the First Schedule to the Law of Property Act 1925 (land held in undivided shares) and Part V of the First Schedule to the Law of Property Act 1925 (Common Land),
(b) takes title on death under section 9 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925, and
(c) maintains a register of notices affecting land under Section 18 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994.
Our vision
Our vision is that OSPT will be a modern, dynamic organisation delivering high quality and efficient client-focused services for vulnerable persons, where those services need to be provided by the public sector.
We are here to achieve justice for those who need our services, to protect the legal, welfare and financial interests of our clients through specialist services designed to meet their needs, and to deliver those services efficiently and effectively to provide value for money to our clients and the taxpayer.

Nuclear Materials  Balance - 2013/14
Nuclear materials  balance figures (also known as ‘Material unaccounted for’, and described in the  industry as inventory differences) for the processing of civil nuclear material  were published annually from 1977 onwards by UKAEA on behalf of the UK  nuclear industry.  Changes in the structure of the industry which followed  from setting-up the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) meant that figures  for 2004/5 and 2005/6 were released, on behalf of the industry, by the then  DTI.  The transfer in April 2007 of operational aspects of the work of the  UK Safeguards Office (UKSO) from DTI to the HSE/ONR means that the figures for  2006/7 onwards have been released, as a matter of routine, on the ONR website.

other languages: Information about reporting side effects
Medical device adverse incidents
The term 'medical device' covers almost all products, except medicines, that are used in healthcare. They can be used for the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring or treatment of illness or disability.
The range of products is very wide: it includes contact lenses and condoms; heart valves and hospital beds; resuscitators and radiotherapy machines; surgical instruments and syringes; wheelchairs and walking frames.
An adverse incident is an event that caused, or almost caused, an injury to a patient or other person or a wrong or delayed diagnosis and treatment of a patient.
Examples of problems:
faulty brakes on a wheelchair
a faulty ear thermometer giving a low reading
a faulty batch of test strips for a blood glucose meter giving wrong readings.
If your equipment has a fault you should let us know as soon as you can. If possible, keep the faulty equipment until you have contacted us.
For more information go to the adverse incidents page involving medical devices on the MHRA website
Defective medicines (those that are not of an acceptable quality)
Defects in medicines may relate to quality issues with the product itself, the packaging, e.g. carton and blister or other packaging components such as the patient information leaflet. Yellow Card reports of defective medicines are submitted to the defective medicines report centre (DMRC).  The role of the DMRC is to minimise the hazard to patients arising from the distribution of defective medicines by providing an emergency assessment and communication system between manufacturers, distributors, regulatory authorities and users.
Where a defective medicine is considered to present a risk to public health, the company or manufacturer as appropriate, is responsible for recalling any affected batch(es) or, in extreme cases, removing all batches of the product from the market.  DMRC normally supports this action by issuing a drug alert notification to healthcare professionals. Other regulators and countries may be notified of a recall by the issue of a Rapid Alert notification.
If a member of the public has reason to believe that their medicine is not of an acceptable quality they should, in the first instance, consult with their doctor or a pharmacist who may then decide to refer the matter to the MHRA.
Further information about defective medicines can be found on the defective medicines pages on the MHRA website
Counterfeit healthcare products
The MHRA makes sure that the UK has systems in place to prevent counterfeit or fake healthcare products entering the supply chain.  If counterfeit products become available, we make sure we detect counterfeits early and take action to protect the public.
When medicines and medical devices are bought on the internet the source of these products is sometimes difficult to trace and it is highly unlikely that the manufacturers of these products conform to European standards of safety and effectiveness. This means there can be a significant risk of harm to the patient or person using the product.
Yellow Card counterfeit reports are investigated in accordance with the terms of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and Consumer Protection Act 1987, and associated legislation.
The MHRA has statutory powers to enter business and private property to seize products suspected of being in breach of the Human Medicines Regulations. Investigations concerning counterfeits can be complex, involving networks of companies and countries, banks, international law enforcement agencies, solicitors, financial investigators, crime analysts, internet investigators, disclosure officers, test purchasers, and specialists in the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
The MHRA can work with manufacturers to resolve any potential issues and problems. However, where necessary, the MHRA has the powers to take formal enforcement action against individuals and organisations. Offenders can be prosecuted under various regulations and Acts which can result in fines and often imprisonment. Civil injunctions are also given, where appropriate.
Further information about counterfeits can be found on the counterfeit medicines and devices pages on the MHRA website .
Blood factors and immunoglobulin products
Blood factor and immunoglobulin products, such as factors I to XIII or Anti-D (RHO) immunoglobulin, are considered medicines.  Suspected side effects to these products should be reported using the Yellow Card side effect form .

About HSE
It is 40 years since the Health   and Safety at Work Act received Royal Assent,   providing a new regulatory   framework for work place health and safety in Great Britain.

This part of the Ofqual website has been designed to give you easier access to respond to our consultations and is open to allow anyone to comment on the work that we do. Each open consultation allows you to respond to as many or as few parts of the document as you wish, meaning that if you are only interested in an aspect of the consultation you can respond to that bit alone.
Consultations
Ofqual is committed to effective consultation; consultation which is targeted at, and easily accessible. In line with the Government’s Code of Practice on Consultation , Ofqual supports the seven criteria:
Formal consultation should take place at a stage when there is scope to influence the policy outcome.
Consultations should normally last for at least 12 weeks with consideration given to longer timescales where feasible and sensible.
Consultation documents should be clear about the consultation process, what is being proposed, the scope to influence and the expected costs and benefits of the proposals.
Consultation exercises should be designed to be accessible to, and clearly targeted at, those people the exercise is intended to reach.
Keeping the burden of consultation to a minimum is essential if consultations are to be effective and if consultees’ buy-in to the process is to be obtained.
Consultation responses should be analysed carefully and clear feedback should be provided to participants following the consultation.
Officials running consultations should seek guidance in how to run an effective consultation exercise and share what they have learned from the experience.
Commenting
We are offering you the opportunity to comment on these consultations and in doing so we'd like you to be aware that we will not usually delete comments so long as you keep within the commenting guidelines below. We will never edit comments that you leave.

We would ask that you avoid posting:
party political material. This is a government website. We cannot publish party political content under the normal rules governing the Civil Service. Essentially it is advisable not to refer specifically to any political party. This does not mean you cannot raise controversial issues,
potentially libelous, false, or defamatory statements,
any commercial endorsement, promotion of any product, service or publication,
language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative. This not only includes obvious swear words and insults, but any language to which people reading it could reasonably take offence,
Please also ensure that your ideas and comments:
are respectful of others - comments should not be malicious or offensive in nature, and should not constitute a personal attack on a person's character,
don't incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality or sexuality or other personal characteristic
don't reveal personal details, such as private addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details
don't break the law - this includes libel, condoning illegal activity, and breaking copyright
are reasonably concise, and don't constitute spamming of the site
are in English - unfortunately, we do not currently have the resource to moderate comments in other languages
are relevant - please don't post messages unrelated to this channel or the subject under discussion
We reserve the right to delete ideas and comments that breach our guidelines and to suspend the ability to comment at any time.

Comments are usually held in a queue before publication and will usually be published within 24 hours of submission.

If you wish to remove a comment that you have made, or enquire about why a comment was moderated, please contact public.enquiries@ofqual.gov.uk with details.

If you have a specific question that requires a response, then you may find it helpful to contact the Ofqual Helpdesk on 0300 303 3342.

Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is a word used to describe a wide variety of different technologies and materials that share one thing in common - their very small size. Because of the wide range of technologies it is more correct to refer to the field of nanotechnologies.
Risk and disability
Risk management
This site provides guidance and tools to help businesses understand what they need to do to assess and control risks in the workplace and comply with health and safety law. Although written with small businesses in mind, the site is relevant   to all businesses.
GOV.UK
Getting started
Good practice in health and safety is good for your business – and it's the law. HSE is here to help – our online advice and tools  can help save you time and effort getting started.
If you think health and safety has to be complicated -it doesn't. Health and safety   made simple will make it easier for you to comply with the law and manage health   and safety in your business.
The health and safety toolbox - How   to control risks at work builds on the basics laid out in Health and safety made   simple and provides the next level of advice to help businesses identify, assess   and control common risks in the workplace.

Courts guidance
This content is mainly for those working in the legal profession in various capacities but will also be useful to individuals looking for information on procedures. It includes the work of the Royal Courts of Justice, the Northampton Bulk Centre, and court hearing lists.
Health and safety made simple
The basics for your business
If you think health and safety has to be complicated - it doesn't.
This site is  for employers and those who want some basic information on what they must do to  make sure their businesses comply with health and safety law.
Managing  health and safety doesn’t have to be complicated, costly or time-consuming. In  fact it’s easier than you think. If you have taken  reasonable steps to prevent accidents or harm to your employees (and the injury  or illness was caused after 1 October 2013), you shouldn’t have to pay  compensation
For  many businesses, all that’s required is a basic series of practical tasks that  protect people from harm and at the same time protect the future success and  growth of your business. The site will take you through the steps and help you  make sure you have done what you need to - and no more.
We’ve introduced the H&S ABC logo onto guidance and  tools to show small and medium-sized businesses just how straightforward health  and safety can be. So when they see the logo, they know that it’s designed  specifically with them in mind.
In general, health and safety laws apply to all businesses.  As an employer, or a self-employed person, you are responsible for health and  safety in your business. Health and safety laws are there to protect you, your  employees and the public from workplace dangers.
The approach you take should be proportionate to the  size of your business and the nature of your business activity. For most small,  low-risk businesses the steps you need to take are straightforward.

The health and safety toolbox: How to control risks at work
Social media
This site provides helpful areas of advice,
which apply to all workplaces.
Introduction
You need to take the right precautions to reduce the risks of workplace dangers and provide a safe working environment.
Health and safety management should be a straightforward part of managing your business as a whole. It involves practical steps that protect people from harm and 			at the same time protect the future success of your business.
How to manage health and safety
Managing health and safety is an integral part of  managing your business. You need to do a risk assessment to find out about the  risks in your workplace, put sensible measures in place to control them, and  make sure they stay controlled.
If you are a small low risk business and have already read Health and Safety Made Simple , then it is likely that you won’t need to read this information. However, if you want more detailed information on particular aspects of managing the health and safety in your workplace such as ‘Consulting your employees’ or ‘Providing supervision’ then you will find it here
Your organisation
This part of the site covers issues that can affect your workers and   may need action at an organisational level.
Each section explains how factors in your workplace can have an   impact, either because of the nature of the work or the way it is managed. The   sections relate to hazards and health issues you may need to assess and take   action to deal with – they could be included in your health and safety   policy.
Your workers
Everyone who works for you needs to know how to work safely and without risks to health. As an employer, giving your workers the right knowledge and skills is not only a legal duty but also can contribute to the success of your business.
Your workplace
You must provide a safe and healthy environment for all your employees and take their welfare needs into account. However, this doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. This applies to a very wide range of workplaces, not only factories, shops and offices but also, for example, schools, hospitals, hotels and places of entertainment.

Health and safety made simple
The basics for your business
If you think health and safety has to be complicated - it doesn't.
This site is  for employers and those who want some basic information on what they must do to  make sure their businesses comply with health and safety law.
Managing  health and safety doesn’t have to be complicated, costly or time-consuming. In  fact it’s easier than you think. If you have taken  reasonable steps to prevent accidents or harm to your employees (and the injury  or illness was caused after 1 October 2013), you shouldn’t have to pay  compensation
For  many businesses, all that’s required is a basic series of practical tasks that  protect people from harm and at the same time protect the future success and  growth of your business. The site will take you through the steps and help you  make sure you have done what you need to - and no more.
We’ve introduced the H&S ABC logo onto guidance and  tools to show small and medium-sized businesses just how straightforward health  and safety can be. So when they see the logo, they know that it’s designed  specifically with them in mind.
In general, health and safety laws apply to all businesses.  As an employer, or a self-employed person, you are responsible for health and  safety in your business. Health and safety laws are there to protect you, your  employees and the public from workplace dangers.
The approach you take should be proportionate to the  size of your business and the nature of your business activity. For most small,  low-risk businesses the steps you need to take are straightforward. If you have  fewer than five employees you don’t have to write down your risk assessment or  your health and safety policy.

Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

Health and safety
It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.
Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,
  as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.

Our health and safety strategy

Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1) Ltd has a 30-year concession to operate and manage the railway between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel.
As the economic and safety regulator for HS1 Ltd, we require the company to be efficient and perform well.
Competition and consumers
Competition and consumers
We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers.
We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.
Track access
Track access
We make sure the passenger and freight train operating companies have fair access to the rail network – and that best use is made of capacity.
If a railway operator wants to access the railway network, they have to apply to us for a track access agreement with Network Rail.
Station and depot access
Station and depot access
We regulate access to station and light maintenance depots by approving station and depot access agreements.
Our role in approving access agreements helps to ensure that the contractual terms for access to a station or depot are fair to the parties concerned, as well as to users of railway services.
Licensing
Licensing
Licensing is one of our core statutory functions. If you want to operate a train, station, network or light maintenance depot you will need to be covered by a licence or licence exemption.
Through licensing we promote effective and efficient working relationships between industry parties and safeguarding the public interest.
Train driver licensing

Investing in the industry
This page outlines ORR's investment framework and guidance for investing in the railway.
The consolidated policy and guidelines (below) set out the legislation and processes for anyone who wishes to invest in the rail industry. We are currently reviewing this document in light of recent changes in the rail industry, particularly the reclassification of Network Rail's debt, and will publish a revised version once we have done this.
We have updated Network Rail's rate of return in our periodic review 2013 (PR13) determination for control period 5 (CP5), which will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019. The revised rate of return for CP5 is 4.93% on an annual basis (and 4.81% on a semi-annual basis). We are reviewing the example calculation of a facility charge spreadsheet and if necessary, we will update it and publish this on this webpage.
Investment is essential to cater for the growth in demand for both passenger and freight services. An effective framework for delivering infrastructure investments such as increasing track capacity or building new stations is required.
We have a role in making sure the investment infrastructures are in place, and once agreed, projects are delivered on time and budget.
Schemes are proposed by train operators, other rail users (in particular users of freight services) or funders of rail services. Others are identified by Network Rail in its role of managing the long term planning process for the railway network.
Network Rail also takes the lead in promoting, planning, facilitating and, in most cases, delivering and financing schemes.

As such, the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise is capped at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a maximum of 6%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. RPI was 3.2% (in July 2012) when the limits were set for this year, so the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2%, and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 9.2%.
There are three exceptions to this:
Merseyrail's concession agreement with the local Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) limits regulated fares to an average increase of RPI (no plus addition).
Northern Rail's agreement with West Yorkshire PTE limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 8%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 3%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 6.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 11.2%.
Southern's franchise agreement limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 3%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 6.2%.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answers on this topic.
If, after reading our guide you still think that we should look at your fare, go to our guidance on how to make a complaint under competition law pdf icon PDF, 47 Kb .
Penalty fares
We have no role in relation to penalty fares. Rules concerning penalty fares are set out in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) .
Train companies will have their own penalty fares scheme. These schemes are approved by the Department for Transport .
If you have been charged a penalty fare and wish to appeal against it, you should contact the relevant train operating company and use its appeal system.
You may also consider seeking advice from Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
Station car park charges
Prices at station car parks are not regulated.
The decision to charge for car parking at a station and, if so, at what level is a commercial decision for the station operator, as it is for any other commercial car parking provider.
If you have concerns about the price of parking at a train station, your first step should be to contact the station operator and voice those concerns.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.

Safety
Safety
This section includes information about station platform gaps and on-train crowding, detailing how to report complaints and our safety policy position.
Platform gaps and stepping distances
The stepping distance between platform edge and train coaches can vary at some stations around the network. If the gap is too big it can be a risk to passengers getting on and off trains.
Read more about platform gaps
Complaints about crowding on trains
How and who to report complaints about on-train passenger crowding; DfT's role in monitoring it and our policy on it, including our specific focus on higher risk situations.
Service disruption
Service disruption
This page provides information about who to contact in case of disruption to your train service due to adverse weather or engineering works.
Service disruption due to adverse weather
You should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Most complaints can be resolved in the first instance by dealing directly with the company responsible.
If you have made a complaint to a train operator, and are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact either Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch for help.
Service disruption due to engineering works
If you have a complaint regarding service disruption due to engineering work you should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Please follow the procedure above for further complaints.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the rail network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. This work is usually carried out at weekends, or weekdays during the early hours of the morning so that disruption to services is kept to a minimum. In most cases the work is planned many weeks in advance, and notices are displayed in relevant stations giving passengers advance notification of the disruption.
However, sometimes emergency engineering work may need to be carried out at short notice to rectify an infrastructure fault that may endanger the safe running of trains – for example in the case of a broken rail. In these circumstances no advance notification can be given.
Train journey information
Information about your train journey
This page includes details of who you should contact if you have a complaint about the passenger information given during your train journey.
If you have a complaint about the information provided to you about your train journey, you should address it to the relevant train operating company . If you are dissatisfied with the train operator's response, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch as appropriate.
Following consultation with stakeholders, we made some changes to licence obligations to require train operating companies to provide good information for passengers, so that they can plan their journeys both in advance and on the day.
These changes enable us to take enforcement action if required to resolve any serious issues.
Further information
Passengers with disabilities
Passengers with disabilities
All licensed train and station operators are required to establish and comply with a Disabled People's Protection Policy (DPPP) which sets out how they will protect the interests of disabled users of their trains and stations.
Making Rail Accessible: ORR's role in enforcing disabled people's protection policies (DPPPs)
We are responsible for making sure that train and station operators have policies and practices in place that protect the interests of older and disabled passengers. We want to use this role to help empower passengers to make confident journeys.
Each train operator produces a booklet called "Making Rail Accessible: Helping older and disabled people". These booklets are available from stations and the websites of individual operators and they explain what additional assistance disabled people can expect to receive to help them when travelling by train. For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
The assistance offered by each operator may vary slightly. However all operators must as a minimum provide the assistance set out below.
If you would like further information on our role in monitoring and enforcing the DPPPs, please see our policy page .
Passenger Assist
Passenger Assist is a service provided by train companies to disabled passengers and others who require assistance with any part of their train journey.
Staff can help you plan your journey, book tickets and make reservations; they can also assist you at stations and on board trains, with anything from changing platforms to finding your seat.
Passenger Assistance is free and available to anyone who needs assistance due to a disability, temporary impairment, or older age. No railcard is required. For more information ask at your local station or visit the website of your local train operator.
Ramps
Operators must provide ramps that are fit for purpose, available at all staffed stations (either at the station or on board the train) to facilitate the boarding or leaving of the train by wheelchair users, whether assistance has been booked in advance or not.
Where this assistance is needed at an unstaffed station, you will need to book it in advance through Passenger Assist. The operator must ensure that they make a member of staff with a ramp available to deliver the assistance.
Alternative accessible transport
Operators must provide, without extra charge, an appropriate alternative accessible service to take disabled passengers to the nearest or most convenient accessible station from where they can continue their journey.
This duty applies where:
the station is inaccessible;
where, for whatever reason, substitute transport is provided to replace rail services (eg because of planned engineering works) that is inaccessible to disabled passengers;
where there is disruption to services at short notice that, for whatever reason, makes services inaccessible to disabled passengers.
Passenger Information
Operators must provide up-to-date information about the accessibility of facilities and services at stations and on their trains on the National Rail Enquiries website, including the Station Journey Planner ('Stations Made Easy'), as well as their own website.
Tickets and fares
Operators must ensure that, where disabled passengers are unable to buy a ticket at a station before their journey, they are able to buy a ticket without penalty on the train or at their destination.
Scooter Carriage
Operators must state in their DPPP their policy regarding the carriage of scooters for mobility-impaired people on their trains. Operators are expected to make the reasoning behind their policy clear in the DPPP, particularly with regard to any policy excluding the carriage of some or all mobility scooters.
Where operators do carry scooters on trains, it is recommended that operators clearly indicate whether passengers are required to transfer to a seat, rather than remain seated on their scooter while on board the train.
Aural and visual information
Operators should give details in their DPPP of their policies for the provision of aural and visual information at stations. This must include a commitment to providing, wherever possible, clear and consistent aural and visual information of train departures and other relevant messages, particularly in the event of delays or disruption.
Information points and displays
Disabled passengers should be able to get all the information they need at a station from one source. Sections A2 and B1 of Accessible train and station design for disabled people provide standards and guidance for information provision.
Luggage
Luggage can be difficult to manage for many disabled people, and operators must ensure that staff will be available to help where this assistance has been arranged in advance (for example through Passenger Assist).
For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
High speed rail (HS2) is a project run by the Department for Transport (DfT).
High speed rail (HS2)
Following a consultation by the DfT, the Government has decided to proceed with the development of a new high speed rail network in the UK, with a first phase between London and the West Midlands.
Further information is available on the DfT website .
Complaints
Complaints
If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond.
Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available.
How to contact the relevant train company
You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments).
Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint.
What happens if you are not happy with the response you get?
If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
What are my rights as a rail passenger?
The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey.
Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website.
You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website.
Health and safety complaints
Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member.
If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request
Complaints about Network Rail
You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry .
Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public.
If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team .
Competition complaints
We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector.
The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition.
Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty.
Read more information about the Competition Act .

9. Search for probate records
1. Overview
When someone dies, you may be able to apply for a ‘grant of representation’. This gives you the legal right to deal with the person’s property, money and possessions (their ‘estate’) - known as ‘probate’.
You can apply yourself or use a solicitor.
Most cases follow the same basic process.
Check if there’s a will - this normally states who sorts out the estate. If there’s no will the next of kin can apply.
Apply to get a ‘grant of representation’ - this gives you the legal right to access things like the person’s bank account.
Pay Inheritance Tax if the estate’s worth over £325,000 and is part of applying for a grant of representation - once you’ve paid any tax due, you can collect the assets.
Collect the assets, eg money from the sale of the person’s property.
Pay any debts, eg unpaid utilities bills.
Distribute the estate - this means giving any property, money or possessions to the people entitled to it (‘beneficiaries’).
A grant of representation can sometimes be known as a ‘grant of probate’, ‘letters of administration’ or ‘letters of administration with a will’.
When a grant of representation may not be needed
You don’t normally need a grant if the estate either:
passes to the surviving spouse/civil partner because it was held in joint names , eg a savings account
this doesn’t include land, property or shares
You should contact the organisation holding the money, eg the bank or building society. They may ask for proof of death, eg the death certificate after the death has been registered .
Each financial institution has its own rules - you may still need to apply for a grant.

Train driver receives prison sentence for ignoring safety systems
Former First Capital Connect train driver, Scott Walford, has received a three-month suspended prison sentence and been ordered to pay costs of £500, after he ignored warnings and safety systems on the Cambridge to London train he was driving – placing passengers and staff on board in great danger. On 7 November, Mr Walford pleaded guilty following a prosecution brought by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for a breach in health and safety law in October 2013.
New ORR data shows passenger journeys at record high
New statistics published today by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) show that the number of passenger journeys on franchised rail services reached 407.7 million between July and September this year (Q2, 2014-15), a 4.4% increase on the same quarter last year.

Open rail
Open rail
Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

What and how we regulate
The Office of Rail Regulation is
  the independent regulator for Britain's rail industry.
We are the economic regulator for railway infrastructure (Network Rail and HS1); the health and safety regulator for the rail industry as a whole – including mainline, metro, tramways and heritage railways across Britain; and the industry's consumer and competition authority.

Health and safety
Health and safety
It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.
Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,
  as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.

Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1) Ltd has a 30-year concession to operate and manage the railway between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel.
As the economic and safety regulator for HS1 Ltd, we require the company to be efficient and perform well.

Competition and consumers
Competition and consumers
We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers.
We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.
Track access
Track access
We make sure the passenger and freight train operating companies have fair access to the rail network – and that best use is made of capacity.
If a railway operator wants to access the railway network, they have to apply to us for a track access agreement with Network Rail.
Station and depot access
Station and depot access
We regulate access to station and light maintenance depots by approving station and depot access agreements.
Our role in approving access agreements helps to ensure that the contractual terms for access to a station or depot are fair to the parties concerned, as well as to users of railway services.
Licensing
Licensing
Licensing is one of our core statutory functions. If you want to operate a train, station, network or light maintenance depot you will need to be covered by a licence or licence exemption.
Through licensing we promote effective and efficient working relationships between industry parties and safeguarding the public interest.

Investing in the industry
This page outlines ORR's investment framework and guidance for investing in the railway.
The consolidated policy and guidelines (below) set out the legislation and processes for anyone who wishes to invest in the rail industry. We are currently reviewing this document in light of recent changes in the rail industry, particularly the reclassification of Network Rail's debt, and will publish a revised version once we have done this.
We have updated Network Rail's rate of return in our periodic review 2013 (PR13) determination for control period 5 (CP5), which will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019. The revised rate of return for CP5 is 4.93% on an annual basis (and 4.81% on a semi-annual basis). We are reviewing the example calculation of a facility charge spreadsheet and if necessary, we will update it and publish this on this webpage.
Investment is essential to cater for the growth in demand for both passenger and freight services. An effective framework for delivering infrastructure investments such as increasing track capacity or building new stations is required.
We have a role in making sure the investment infrastructures are in place, and once agreed, projects are delivered on time and budget.
Schemes are proposed by train operators, other rail users (in particular users of freight services) or funders of rail services. Others are identified by Network Rail in its role of managing the long term planning process for the railway network.
Network Rail also takes the lead in promoting, planning, facilitating and, in most cases, delivering and financing schemes.

Open rail
Our Open rail section aims to provide clear information about railway funding and how the industry is performing.
For details of which fare types are regulated, please see the Strategic Rail Authority's Fares Review Conclusions 2003 pdf icon PDF, 808 Kb .
As such, the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise is capped at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a maximum of 6%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. RPI was 3.2% (in July 2012) when the limits were set for this year, so the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2%, and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 9.2%.
There are three exceptions to this:
Merseyrail's concession agreement with the local Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) limits regulated fares to an average increase of RPI (no plus addition).
Northern Rail's agreement with West Yorkshire PTE limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 8%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 3%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 6.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 11.2%.
Southern's franchise agreement limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 3%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 6.2%.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answers on this topic.
If, after reading our guide you still think that we should look at your fare, go to our guidance on how to make a complaint under competition law pdf icon PDF, 47 Kb .
Penalty fares
We have no role in relation to penalty fares. Rules concerning penalty fares are set out in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) .
Train companies will have their own penalty fares scheme. These schemes are approved by the Department for Transport .
If you have been charged a penalty fare and wish to appeal against it, you should contact the relevant train operating company and use its appeal system.
You may also consider seeking advice from Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
Station car park charges
Prices at station car parks are not regulated.
The decision to charge for car parking at a station and, if so, at what level is a commercial decision for the station operator, as it is for any other commercial car parking provider.
If you have concerns about the price of parking at a train station, your first step should be to contact the station operator and voice those concerns.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answer on this topic.

Service disruption
This page provides information about who to contact in case of disruption to your train service due to adverse weather or engineering works.
Service disruption due to adverse weather
You should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Most complaints can be resolved in the first instance by dealing directly with the company responsible.
If you have made a complaint to a train operator, and are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact either Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch for help.
Service disruption due to engineering works
If you have a complaint regarding service disruption due to engineering work you should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Please follow the procedure above for further complaints.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the rail network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. This work is usually carried out at weekends, or weekdays during the early hours of the morning so that disruption to services is kept to a minimum. In most cases the work is planned many weeks in advance, and notices are displayed in relevant stations giving passengers advance notification of the disruption.
However, sometimes emergency engineering work may need to be carried out at short notice to rectify an infrastructure fault that may endanger the safe running of trains – for example in the case of a broken rail. In these circumstances no advance notification can be given.
Train journey information
Information about your train journey
This page includes details of who you should contact if you have a complaint about the passenger information given during your train journey.
If you have a complaint about the information provided to you about your train journey, you should address it to the relevant train operating company . If you are dissatisfied with the train operator's response, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch as appropriate.
Following consultation with stakeholders, we made some changes to licence obligations to require train operating companies to provide good information for passengers, so that they can plan their journeys both in advance and on the day.
These changes enable us to take enforcement action if required to resolve any serious issues.
Further information
Passengers with disabilities
Passengers with disabilities
All licensed train and station operators are required to establish and comply with a Disabled People's Protection Policy (DPPP) which sets out how they will protect the interests of disabled users of their trains and stations.
Making Rail Accessible: ORR's role in enforcing disabled people's protection policies (DPPPs)
We are responsible for making sure that train and station operators have policies and practices in place that protect the interests of older and disabled passengers. We want to use this role to help empower passengers to make confident journeys.
Each train operator produces a booklet called "Making Rail Accessible: Helping older and disabled people". These booklets are available from stations and the websites of individual operators and they explain what additional assistance disabled people can expect to receive to help them when travelling by train. For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
The assistance offered by each operator may vary slightly. However all operators must as a minimum provide the assistance set out below.
If you would like further information on our role in monitoring and enforcing the DPPPs, please see our policy page .
Passenger Assist
Passenger Assist is a service provided by train companies to disabled passengers and others who require assistance with any part of their train journey.
Staff can help you plan your journey, book tickets and make reservations; they can also assist you at stations and on board trains, with anything from changing platforms to finding your seat.
Passenger Assistance is free and available to anyone who needs assistance due to a disability, temporary impairment, or older age. No railcard is required. For more information ask at your local station or visit the website of your local train operator.
Ramps
Operators must provide ramps that are fit for purpose, available at all staffed stations (either at the station or on board the train) to facilitate the boarding or leaving of the train by wheelchair users, whether assistance has been booked in advance or not.
Where this assistance is needed at an unstaffed station, you will need to book it in advance through Passenger Assist. The operator must ensure that they make a member of staff with a ramp available to deliver the assistance.
Alternative accessible transport
Operators must provide, without extra charge, an appropriate alternative accessible service to take disabled passengers to the nearest or most convenient accessible station from where they can continue their journey.
This duty applies where:
the station is inaccessible;
where, for whatever reason, substitute transport is provided to replace rail services (eg because of planned engineering works) that is inaccessible to disabled passengers;
where there is disruption to services at short notice that, for whatever reason, makes services inaccessible to disabled passengers.
Passenger Information
Operators must provide up-to-date information about the accessibility of facilities and services at stations and on their trains on the National Rail Enquiries website, including the Station Journey Planner ('Stations Made Easy'), as well as their own website.
Tickets and fares
Operators must ensure that, where disabled passengers are unable to buy a ticket at a station before their journey, they are able to buy a ticket without penalty on the train or at their destination.
Scooter Carriage
Operators must state in their DPPP their policy regarding the carriage of scooters for mobility-impaired people on their trains. Operators are expected to make the reasoning behind their policy clear in the DPPP, particularly with regard to any policy excluding the carriage of some or all mobility scooters.
Where operators do carry scooters on trains, it is recommended that operators clearly indicate whether passengers are required to transfer to a seat, rather than remain seated on their scooter while on board the train.
Aural and visual information
Operators should give details in their DPPP of their policies for the provision of aural and visual information at stations. This must include a commitment to providing, wherever possible, clear and consistent aural and visual information of train departures and other relevant messages, particularly in the event of delays or disruption.
Information points and displays
Disabled passengers should be able to get all the information they need at a station from one source. Sections A2 and B1 of Accessible train and station design for disabled people provide standards and guidance for information provision.
Luggage
Luggage can be difficult to manage for many disabled people, and operators must ensure that staff will be available to help where this assistance has been arranged in advance (for example through Passenger Assist).
For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
High speed rail (HS2) is a project run by the Department for Transport (DfT).
High speed rail (HS2)
Following a consultation by the DfT, the Government has decided to proceed with the development of a new high speed rail network in the UK, with a first phase between London and the West Midlands.
Further information is available on the DfT website .
Complaints
Complaints
If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond.
Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available.
How to contact the relevant train company
You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments).
Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint.
What happens if you are not happy with the response you get?
If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
What are my rights as a rail passenger?
The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey.
Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website.
You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website.
Health and safety complaints
Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member.
If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request
Complaints about Network Rail
You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry .
Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public.
If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team .
Competition complaints
We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector.
The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition.
Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty.
Read more information about the Competition Act .

unfair dismissal
redundancy payments and
discrimination.
We also deal with a range of claims relating to wages and other payments. You can get a full list, called a jurisdiction list , from any local tribunal office or the Employment Tribunals public enquiry line:
England & Wales: 0300 123 1024
Scotland: 0141 354 8574

An Employment Tribunal is like a court but it is not as formal; for example, nobody wears a wig or gown. However, like a court it must act independently and cannot give legal advice. Almost all hearings are open to the public.
Important notices
From 6 April nearly everyone who applies to an employment tribunal should first contact Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service). Find out more about Early Conciliation with Acas.

The First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) is an independent Tribunal dealing with appeals against decisions made by the Home Secretary and her officials in immigration, asylum and nationality matters.
The main types of appeal we receive are made against decisions to:
Refuse a person asylum in the UK.
Refuse a person entry to, or leave to remain in, the UK.
Appeals are heard by one or more Judges who are sometimes accompanied by non legal members of the Tribunal. Judges and non legal members are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and together form an independent judicial body.
Fees are payable on many Immigration and Asylum Appeals.
Immigration and Appeals Tribunal fees guidance
We hear appeals in a number of hearing centres across the United Kingdom. Where the appeal is being decided at an oral hearing, the person making the appeal (the appellant), their representative and a representative from the Home Office can attend. If you are an appellant without a representative please see leaflet T359 - Immigration guidance for unrepresented appellants .
The Judge (or panel) will decide whether the appeal against the decision of the Home Office should be allowed or dismissed.This will be provided in a written decision and in most cases will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons.
In certain circumstances, either the appellant or respondent may apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

Train driver receives prison sentence for ignoring safety systems
Former First Capital Connect train driver, Scott Walford, has received a three-month suspended prison sentence and been ordered to pay costs of £500, after he ignored warnings and safety systems on the Cambridge to London train he was driving – placing passengers and staff on board in great danger. On 7 November, Mr Walford pleaded guilty following a prosecution brought by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for a breach in health and safety law in October 2013.
It also deals with disputes about:
Child Support; Tax Credits
Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) / Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)
Compensation Recovery Scheme/ Road Traffic (NHS) charges
Vaccine Damage
and decisions on Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
Our aim is to help you through your appeal and explain to you, step-by-step, the procedure of an appeal.
The Social Security and Child Support (SSCS) Tribunal is part of HM Courts & Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. The tribunal consists of two bodies within a single organisation:
An independent appeal tribunal function (constituted as a tribunal non-departmental public body) with responsibility for the judicial functioning of appeal tribunals. This function is headed by the Social Entitlement Chamber President.
An executive agency with responsibility for the administration of appeals. This function is headed by the Chief Executive of  HM Courts & Tribunals Service.
We arrange independent hearings for appeals on decisions made by the Department for Work and Pensions (including Jobcentre Plus, Child Support Agency and Disability and Carers Service), as well as other government departments (HM Revenue and Customs) and local authorities.
Appeals are determined by independent tribunal panels whose decisions cannot normally be changed other than by way of a further appeal to the Upper Tribunal.
Appeals are heard at our tribunal venues and are processed at seven operational sites throughout Great Britain.
We have a purpose statement that describes what we seek to do:
"To bring together the parties to the appeal, and the judiciary, with all appropriate resources for the fair and independent delivery of decisions. We will do this in a way that best meets the expectations of all parties to the appeal and the demands of the public purse."

Open rail
Open rail
Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

What and how we regulate
The Office of Rail Regulation is
  the independent regulator for Britain's rail industry.
We are the economic regulator for railway infrastructure (Network Rail and HS1); the health and safety regulator for the rail industry as a whole – including mainline, metro, tramways and heritage railways across Britain; and the industry's consumer and competition authority.

Health and safety
Health and safety
It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.
Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,
  as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.
How to report an incident
Find out how to report an incident under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013.

Our health and safety strategy
Our approach to regulating the health and safety risks created and managed by businesses in the rail industry.
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.

Special Educational Needs and Disability
From 1 September 2014 the process of assessing the needs and making educational provision for children with special educational needs will start to change.
Children and young people from 0 – 25 years can pursue appeals in the Tribunal and young people over the statutory school age of 16 can appeal in their own right, rather than through their parents.
New requests to local authorities for an education, health and care assessment will follow the new legislation Children and Families Act 2014 .
Children and young people who already have a statement of special educational needs maintained by their local authority, will see a gradual transition into the new arrangements.
Until the new system is fully implemented, there will be different legal considerations by the tribunal depending on whether the appeal involves a statement or an EHC plan. To help you with the process, different forms are being used and different versions of the guidance are available depending on the type of appeal.

PIM
The Train Accident Precursor Indicator Model (the PIM) managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), measures the risk, per million train miles, of a train accident - i.e. collision, derailment, fire or striking a road vehicle on a level crossing. The measure incorporates 82 precursor events
  in eight groups. Around 65% of the risk arises from events largely under the control or the responsibility of Network Rail, e.g. track geometry, infrastructure failures, environmental factors (flooding, land slips etc.) and level crossing misuse.
The PIM risk indicator was set to a reference value of 100 at the end of March 2002 and the PIM risk indicator provides a measure of the change in risk relative to this level. A reduction in the index is therefore beneficial, denoting a reduction in risk.
Plain line
Track that does not have any junctions, crossovers or points on it.
Points failure
A fault within a set of points (switches and crossings).
Possession disruption index (PDI)
'Possession disruption index – passenger' (PDI-P) and 'Possession disruption index – freight (PDI-F)': a graph indicating the level of disruption caused by possessions over a period of time.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities.
These restrictions of access are referred to as possessions. Possessions are considered to be 'disruptive' if they impact on the running of passenger or freight operators' normal timetabled services.
Possessions
Network Rail needs to restrict access to its network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. These restrictions of access are referred to as possessions.
Possessions returns

We are conducting a small survey on the quarterly and annual statistical releases and the quality reports we now produce. Your feedback will tell us how you have found these in the last year, help us with making further improvements and aim to give you the information that you need. Here is the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/statsreleases_qualreports . It should take about 5-10 minutes and closing date is Friday 16th January 2015. Thank you.
Following user feedback, we are in the process of adding reference numbers to tabular data which is published on the portal for the Report Wizard and Data Portal reports.  This process will be taking place over a time period and will be done on a category by category basis.  This means that some reports will have table numbers sooner than others.
Owing to data supply issues, we are unable to publish the 2013-14 annual data for the impact of freight on road haulage and the market share for rail freight. We are working with our data suppliers and shall provide an update on timescales on the data portal as soon as we have more information.  ORR apologises for any inconvenience this may cause.
Precursor Indicator Model Publication
The Railway Safety Standard Board's (RSSB) Precursor Indicator Model (PIM) has been published on the ORR Data Portal since 9th May 2011.  RSSB have now taken the decision to publish the raw data on their website.   To avoid duplication of effort, the ORR has decided to withdraw this publication from the ORR Data Portal.  For further details concerning this change, please review the further information page of the portal.

As part of our commitment to improving the quality of our statistics in line with requirements for National Statistics accreditation, we introduced themed statistical releases in the latter part of 2013. These will provide contextual commentary on statistics across a common topic (e.g. rail usage) and will aid the user in the interpretation of the data. This means that we will no longer be producing the quarterly summary in its current form, with quarter 4 2012-13 (Jan – Mar 2013) being the last one. Please contact us at rail.stats@orr.gsi.gov.uk for more information.
The data wizard reports relating to service satisfaction have been removed from the Data Portal as many of them are due to be revised.  Alternative service satisfaction data may be viewed in the form of pre-created reports at service satisfaction reports .
There are some changes to the following publications.

Tax Tribunal guidance
First–tier Tribunal (Tax) hears appeals against decisions relating to tax made by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Appeals can be made by individuals or organisations, single tax payers or large multi-national companies. Appeals range from the relatively simple to the complex across both direct and indirect tax. Direct tax is a tax that is usually levied directly on an individual or organisation, such as income tax or corporation tax. Indirect tax refers to tax that is usually levied on goods or services rather than on an individual or organisation, such as VAT or Customs Duty. This website provides information about the Tax Chamber's rules and procedures and gives guidance on how to appeal.
Appeals against HMRC decisions in relation to tax heard in the Tax Chamber include:
Income Tax
National Insurance Contributions
Statutory Payments
VAT or duties such as custom duties, excise duties or landfill tax, aggregates or climate change levies
The amounts of tax or duty to be paid, against penalties imposed upon them and against certain other decisions.
Please note that appeals against decisions in relation to tax credits are heard by the First-tier Tribunal (Social Security and Child Support) .
About us
The Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal was established on 1 April 2009. It replaces the four former separate Tax Tribunals, namely:
the General Commissioners;
VAT & Duties; and
Section 706 Tribunals.
The Tax Chamber is independent of HMRC and hears most appeals against decision of HMRC in relation to tax. The onward appeal from the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) is to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery).
Appeals are heard by panels that are constituted according to the needs of the case, and may be heard by legally qualified Judges, non-legally qualified expert Members or a mix of the two. The jurisdiction of the tax tribunal is UK-wide, and hearings are held inTribunal Service venues across the United Kingdom.
What you can expect from us
When dealing with a matter before the First-tier Tribunal (Tax), we will;
deal with correspondence within five working days of receiving it;
register new appeals and references within 10 working days of receiving them;
send decisions to parties of the appeal within five working days of signature by the Judge. The Judge will sign (but not date) the decision once it has been agreed. This can typically be about one or two months after the last day of hearing. The decision will bear the date that it is formally released to the parties of the appeal; and
send decisions to public subscribers (individuals, or organisations, who are not directly associated with the appeal and have requested a copy of the decision) within 10 working days of informing the parties of the outcome of the appeal

RSS Feeds
RSS Feeds
The Office of Rail Regulation website uses a free newsfeed so you can stay up to date with our latest Publications, Press Notices and Consultations.
What is RSS?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for distributing news content and is a simple way to keep up to date with the latest news on a website without having to visit the site.
Websites publish via RSS and then individuals or other websites automatically get the updated content via a 'news aggregator' or 'news reader'. Typically, an item in an RSS feed will only contain a title, excerpt or description, and link back to the original, more detailed content.
News aggregators or news readers
If you want to receive RSS you will need a news reader. Some you can access using a browser, and some are applications that need to be downloaded onto your computer. There is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time.

Different news readers work on different operating systems, so you will need to take this into account when you make your choice.
A list of news readers include:

Only businesses that have been authorised by the Ministry of Justice are legally
                allowed to provide regulated claims management services.
Authorisation does not mean that a business is recommended or endorsed by the
                    Ministry of Justice.
If a claims management business has told you that it is recommended or endorsed
                by the Ministry of Justice please report this to us here .
You can search by business name, trading name or authorisation number, and the search
            result will list any businesses that may match your search criteria.
The search facility also finds businesses that have been authorised by the Regulator
            in the past but whose authorisation is now suspended, cancelled or surrendered.
            Consumers who have an agreement with a claims management business that has had its
            authorisation suspended or cancelled should read our Consumer Factsheet â€“ suspended or cancelled business.

The National Rail Trends (NRT) Portal provides access to up-to-date statistics held by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). Registration is free and simple, and provides access to all content and functionality of the NRT portal. Register now to create your own reports.
We are conducting a small survey on the quarterly and annual statistical releases and the quality reports we now produce. Your feedback will tell us how you have found these in the last year, help us with making further improvements and aim to give you the information that you need. Here is the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/statsreleases_qualreports . It should take about 5-10 minutes and closing date is Friday 16th January 2015. Thank you.
Following user feedback, we are in the process of adding reference numbers to tabular data which is published on the portal for the Report Wizard and Data Portal reports.  This process will be taking place over a time period and will be done on a category by category basis.  This means that some reports will have table numbers sooner than others.
Owing to data supply issues, we are unable to publish the 2013-14 annual data for the impact of freight on road haulage and the market share for rail freight. We are working with our data suppliers and shall provide an update on timescales on the data portal as soon as we have more information.  ORR apologises for any inconvenience this may cause.
Precursor Indicator Model Publication
The Railway Safety Standard Board's (RSSB) Precursor Indicator Model (PIM) has been published on the ORR Data Portal since 9th May 2011.  RSSB have now taken the decision to publish the raw data on their website.   To avoid duplication of effort, the ORR has decided to withdraw this publication from the ORR Data Portal.  For further details concerning this change, please review the further information page of the portal.
For any further information, please contact the statistics Head of Profession, Fazilat Dar at rstats@orr.gsi.gov.uk on 0207 282 3705.
As part of our commitment to improving the quality of our statistics in line with requirements for National Statistics accreditation, we introduced themed statistical releases in the latter part of 2013. These will provide contextual commentary on statistics across a common topic (e.g. rail usage) and will aid the user in the interpretation of the data. This means that we will no longer be producing the quarterly summary in its current form, with quarter 4 2012-13 (Jan – Mar 2013) being the last one. Please contact us at rail.stats@orr.gsi.gov.uk for more information.
The data wizard reports relating to service satisfaction have been removed from the Data Portal as many of them are due to be revised.  Alternative service satisfaction data may be viewed in the form of pre-created reports at service satisfaction reports .
There are some changes to the following publications.
Rail Market Share
Complaints: London Travel Watch and Passenger Focus

Further Information
Precusors Indicator Model
The Railway Safety Standard Board's (RSSB) Precursor Indicator Model (PIM) has been published on the ORR Data Portal since 9th May 2011.  RSSB have now taken the decision to publish the raw data on their website.  This will be more frequently updated and presented at a lower level of aggregation than was done to date on the ORR Data Portal.  To avoid duplication of effort, the ORR has decided to withdraw this publication from the ORR Data Portal.  Historical data has been removed from the Data Portal since RSSB has also amended their method of producing the PIM which means that this historical data is no longer consistent with the latest published data, because in the revised PIM, RSSB is now using additional risk-ranked data provided by Network Rail, such as track condition, landslip and structure risk data.
To access the latest PIM data, please visit the RSSB webpage at http://www.safetyriskmodel.co.uk/pages/default.aspx . Please note that registration and login is required to download the excel spreadsheet containing the raw numbers.
Rail market share publication
Rail market share was due to be published on 25th July 2013 as part of the freight market indicators release. ORR have not received freight data for other modes of transport from the Department for Transport so we were unable to publish the dataset at this time. The other tables within freight market indicators, impact on road haulage and number of freight train movements were published as scheduled. The updated publication date for rail market share will be confirmed when we are in receipt of the data.  DfT road freight data are not yet available for 2011 though it is hoped that updated estimates will be produced later in 2014.
Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch publication
As part of our commitment to maintaining the quality of all our data, we run a quality assurance process. This process identified issues with comparability between the London TravelWatch and Passenger Focus data used to produce the Appeals opened by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table and Complaints received by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table. As data quality is critical, we did not publish the 2012-13 Q4 update to the Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table on Thursday 20th June. The remaining data for 2012-13 was published on Thursday 17th October. However, due to differences in methodology between London TravelWatch and Passenger Focus for the appeals opened data, from 2013-14 we will not publish the data for the foreseeable future. Passenger Focus intend to publish statistics on the number of appeals resolved and we will be sign-posting to their website once published. We still have concerns over the data quality for the Complaints received by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table and therefore will not publish the data for the foreseeable future. Please contact us if you would like more information. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this causes.
Crowding Data Publication
Our commitment to transparency means working with our data providers to ensure relevant datasets are disseminated to users, while at the same time avoiding duplication. Crowding data is an area where we believe we can become more efficient. To date, subsets of the crowding data have been supplied to us by Department for Transport (DfT) and published on the NRT Data Portal, despite them already being published on the DfT website at an earlier date. From August 2013 we will therefore stop publishing the crowding data and instead provide a reference (sign-posting) to the data on the DfT website. The sign-posting will start with the 2012-13 data, which was published by DfT on the 24th July 2013.

Further Information
Precusors Indicator Model
The Railway Safety Standard Board's (RSSB) Precursor Indicator Model (PIM) has been published on the ORR Data Portal since 9th May 2011.  RSSB have now taken the decision to publish the raw data on their website.  This will be more frequently updated and presented at a lower level of aggregation than was done to date on the ORR Data Portal.  To avoid duplication of effort, the ORR has decided to withdraw this publication from the ORR Data Portal.  Historical data has been removed from the Data Portal since RSSB has also amended their method of producing the PIM which means that this historical data is no longer consistent with the latest published data, because in the revised PIM, RSSB is now using additional risk-ranked data provided by Network Rail, such as track condition, landslip and structure risk data.
To access the latest PIM data, please visit the RSSB webpage at http://www.safetyriskmodel.co.uk/pages/default.aspx . Please note that registration and login is required to download the excel spreadsheet containing the raw numbers.
Rail market share publication
Rail market share was due to be published on 25th July 2013 as part of the freight market indicators release. ORR have not received freight data for other modes of transport from the Department for Transport so we were unable to publish the dataset at this time. The other tables within freight market indicators, impact on road haulage and number of freight train movements were published as scheduled. The updated publication date for rail market share will be confirmed when we are in receipt of the data.  DfT road freight data are not yet available for 2011 though it is hoped that updated estimates will be produced later in 2014.
Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch publication
As part of our commitment to maintaining the quality of all our data, we run a quality assurance process. This process identified issues with comparability between the London TravelWatch and Passenger Focus data used to produce the Appeals opened by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table and Complaints received by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table. As data quality is critical, we did not publish the 2012-13 Q4 update to the Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table on Thursday 20th June. The remaining data for 2012-13 was published on Thursday 17th October. However, due to differences in methodology between London TravelWatch and Passenger Focus for the appeals opened data, from 2013-14 we will not publish the data for the foreseeable future. Passenger Focus intend to publish statistics on the number of appeals resolved and we will be sign-posting to their website once published. We still have concerns over the data quality for the Complaints received by Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch table and therefore will not publish the data for the foreseeable future. Please contact us if you would like more information. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this causes.

Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1) Ltd has a 30-year concession to operate and manage the railway between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel.
As the economic and safety regulator for HS1 Ltd, we require the company to be efficient and perform well.
Competition and consumers
Competition and consumers
We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers.
We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.
Track access
Track access
We make sure the passenger and freight train operating companies have fair access to the rail network – and that best use is made of capacity.
If a railway operator wants to access the railway network, they have to apply to us for a track access agreement with Network Rail.
Station and depot access
Station and depot access
We regulate access to station and light maintenance depots by approving station and depot access agreements.
Our role in approving access agreements helps to ensure that the contractual terms for access to a station or depot are fair to the parties concerned, as well as to users of railway services.
Licensing
Licensing
Licensing is one of our core statutory functions. If you want to operate a train, station, network or light maintenance depot you will need to be covered by a licence or licence exemption.
Through licensing we promote effective and efficient working relationships between industry parties and safeguarding the public interest.

Investing in the industry
This page outlines ORR's investment framework and guidance for investing in the railway.
The consolidated policy and guidelines (below) set out the legislation and processes for anyone who wishes to invest in the rail industry. We are currently reviewing this document in light of recent changes in the rail industry, particularly the reclassification of Network Rail's debt, and will publish a revised version once we have done this.
We have updated Network Rail's rate of return in our periodic review 2013 (PR13) determination for control period 5 (CP5), which will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019. The revised rate of return for CP5 is 4.93% on an annual basis (and 4.81% on a semi-annual basis). We are reviewing the example calculation of a facility charge spreadsheet and if necessary, we will update it and publish this on this webpage.
Investment is essential to cater for the growth in demand for both passenger and freight services. An effective framework for delivering infrastructure investments such as increasing track capacity or building new stations is required.
We have a role in making sure the investment infrastructures are in place, and once agreed, projects are delivered on time and budget.
Schemes are proposed by train operators, other rail users (in particular users of freight services) or funders of rail services. Others are identified by Network Rail in its role of managing the long term planning process for the railway network.
Network Rail also takes the lead in promoting, planning, facilitating and, in most cases, delivering and financing schemes.

Open rail
Our Open rail section aims to provide clear information about railway funding and how the industry is performing.
For details of which fare types are regulated, please see the Strategic Rail Authority's Fares Review Conclusions 2003 pdf icon PDF, 808 Kb .
As such, the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise is capped at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a maximum of 6%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. RPI was 3.2% (in July 2012) when the limits were set for this year, so the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2%, and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 9.2%.
There are three exceptions to this:
Merseyrail's concession agreement with the local Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) limits regulated fares to an average increase of RPI (no plus addition).
Northern Rail's agreement with West Yorkshire PTE limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 8%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 3%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 6.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 11.2%.
Southern's franchise agreement limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 3%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 6.2%.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answers on this topic.
If, after reading our guide you still think that we should look at your fare, go to our guidance on how to make a complaint under competition law pdf icon PDF, 47 Kb .
Penalty fares
We have no role in relation to penalty fares. Rules concerning penalty fares are set out in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) .
Train companies will have their own penalty fares scheme. These schemes are approved by the Department for Transport .
If you have been charged a penalty fare and wish to appeal against it, you should contact the relevant train operating company and use its appeal system.
You may also consider seeking advice from Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.

Station car park charges
Prices at station car parks are not regulated.
The decision to charge for car parking at a station and, if so, at what level is a commercial decision for the station operator, as it is for any other commercial car parking provider.
If you have concerns about the price of parking at a train station, your first step should be to contact the station operator and voice those concerns.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answer on this topic.

Service disruption
Service disruption
This page provides information about who to contact in case of disruption to your train service due to adverse weather or engineering works.
Service disruption due to adverse weather
You should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Most complaints can be resolved in the first instance by dealing directly with the company responsible.
If you have made a complaint to a train operator, and are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact either Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch for help.
Service disruption due to engineering works
If you have a complaint regarding service disruption due to engineering work you should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Please follow the procedure above for further complaints.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the rail network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. This work is usually carried out at weekends, or weekdays during the early hours of the morning so that disruption to services is kept to a minimum. In most cases the work is planned many weeks in advance, and notices are displayed in relevant stations giving passengers advance notification of the disruption.
However, sometimes emergency engineering work may need to be carried out at short notice to rectify an infrastructure fault that may endanger the safe running of trains – for example in the case of a broken rail. In these circumstances no advance notification can be given.
Train journey information
Information about your train journey
This page includes details of who you should contact if you have a complaint about the passenger information given during your train journey.
If you have a complaint about the information provided to you about your train journey, you should address it to the relevant train operating company . If you are dissatisfied with the train operator's response, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch as appropriate.
Following consultation with stakeholders, we made some changes to licence obligations to require train operating companies to provide good information for passengers, so that they can plan their journeys both in advance and on the day.
These changes enable us to take enforcement action if required to resolve any serious issues.
Further information
Passengers with disabilities
Passengers with disabilities
All licensed train and station operators are required to establish and comply with a Disabled People's Protection Policy (DPPP) which sets out how they will protect the interests of disabled users of their trains and stations.
Making Rail Accessible: ORR's role in enforcing disabled people's protection policies (DPPPs)
We are responsible for making sure that train and station operators have policies and practices in place that protect the interests of older and disabled passengers. We want to use this role to help empower passengers to make confident journeys.
Each train operator produces a booklet called "Making Rail Accessible: Helping older and disabled people". These booklets are available from stations and the websites of individual operators and they explain what additional assistance disabled people can expect to receive to help them when travelling by train. For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
The assistance offered by each operator may vary slightly. However all operators must as a minimum provide the assistance set out below.
If you would like further information on our role in monitoring and enforcing the DPPPs, please see our policy page .
Passenger Assist
Passenger Assist is a service provided by train companies to disabled passengers and others who require assistance with any part of their train journey.
Staff can help you plan your journey, book tickets and make reservations; they can also assist you at stations and on board trains, with anything from changing platforms to finding your seat.
Passenger Assistance is free and available to anyone who needs assistance due to a disability, temporary impairment, or older age. No railcard is required. For more information ask at your local station or visit the website of your local train operator.
Ramps
Operators must provide ramps that are fit for purpose, available at all staffed stations (either at the station or on board the train) to facilitate the boarding or leaving of the train by wheelchair users, whether assistance has been booked in advance or not.
Where this assistance is needed at an unstaffed station, you will need to book it in advance through Passenger Assist. The operator must ensure that they make a member of staff with a ramp available to deliver the assistance.
Alternative accessible transport
Operators must provide, without extra charge, an appropriate alternative accessible service to take disabled passengers to the nearest or most convenient accessible station from where they can continue their journey.
This duty applies where:
the station is inaccessible;
where, for whatever reason, substitute transport is provided to replace rail services (eg because of planned engineering works) that is inaccessible to disabled passengers;
where there is disruption to services at short notice that, for whatever reason, makes services inaccessible to disabled passengers.
Passenger Information
Operators must provide up-to-date information about the accessibility of facilities and services at stations and on their trains on the National Rail Enquiries website, including the Station Journey Planner ('Stations Made Easy'), as well as their own website.
Tickets and fares
Operators must ensure that, where disabled passengers are unable to buy a ticket at a station before their journey, they are able to buy a ticket without penalty on the train or at their destination.
Scooter Carriage
Operators must state in their DPPP their policy regarding the carriage of scooters for mobility-impaired people on their trains. Operators are expected to make the reasoning behind their policy clear in the DPPP, particularly with regard to any policy excluding the carriage of some or all mobility scooters.
Where operators do carry scooters on trains, it is recommended that operators clearly indicate whether passengers are required to transfer to a seat, rather than remain seated on their scooter while on board the train.
Aural and visual information
Operators should give details in their DPPP of their policies for the provision of aural and visual information at stations. This must include a commitment to providing, wherever possible, clear and consistent aural and visual information of train departures and other relevant messages, particularly in the event of delays or disruption.
Information points and displays
Disabled passengers should be able to get all the information they need at a station from one source. Sections A2 and B1 of Accessible train and station design for disabled people provide standards and guidance for information provision.
Luggage
Luggage can be difficult to manage for many disabled people, and operators must ensure that staff will be available to help where this assistance has been arranged in advance (for example through Passenger Assist).
For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
High speed rail (HS2) is a project run by the Department for Transport (DfT).
High speed rail (HS2)
Following a consultation by the DfT, the Government has decided to proceed with the development of a new high speed rail network in the UK, with a first phase between London and the West Midlands.
Further information is available on the DfT website .
Complaints
Complaints
If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond.
Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available.
How to contact the relevant train company
You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments).
Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint.
What happens if you are not happy with the response you get?
If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
What are my rights as a rail passenger?
The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey.
Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website.
You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website.
Health and safety complaints
Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member.
If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request
Complaints about Network Rail
You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry .
Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public.
If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team .
Competition complaints
We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector.
The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition.
Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty.
Read more information about the Competition Act .

If you don’t have a client reference number, use your client’s name and date of birth or address.
If your client’s application is refused, you can appeal. Depending on what you applied for, there may be an appeal form with your reply or if you applied through CCMS, you can appeal online. Find out more about legal aid appeals.
Make a crime application
To apply for criminal legal aid for legal representation in the courts, your client must complete form CRM14 and where applicable form CRM15.
They’ll need to pass a means test (financial) and a merits test, Interests of Justice (IoJ), to ensure they’re eligible for criminal legal aid.
Apply online (crime)
Use the CRM14 eForm in place of the paper CRM14 and CRM15 forms to apply for criminal legal aid online. This is only available in some areas however we are in the process of rolling it out nationally. Find out more about eForms including whether the CRM14 is available in your area.
Supply the correct evidence
The individual forms and guidance tell you what evidence is needed. Not supplying it is a common reason for applications being delayed and rejected.
Sign and date forms
Many applications are rejected for avoidable reasons, eg the form is left unsigned, not dated or is incomplete. Please remember to check your forms before sending. This could save you time later.
Where to send your forms
Most applications for criminal legal aid are currently sent to the magistrates’ court where your client’s case will be heard. 
This includes cases which end up in the crown court.
It’s important to note that during 2014/15, the processing of criminal applications is transferring to the LAA. Please see the LAA news story for further information.
If you are applying for criminal legal aid in Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire courts your paper application must be sent to the LAA’s Nottingham office.

Train driver receives prison sentence for ignoring safety systems
Former First Capital Connect train driver, Scott Walford, has received a three-month suspended prison sentence and been ordered to pay costs of £500, after he ignored warnings and safety systems on the Cambridge to London train he was driving – placing passengers and staff on board in great danger. On 7 November, Mr Walford pleaded guilty following a prosecution brought by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for a breach in health and safety law in October 2013.
New ORR data shows passenger journeys at record high
New statistics published today by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) show that the number of passenger journeys on franchised rail services reached 407.7 million between July and September this year (Q2, 2014-15), a 4.4% increase on the same quarter last year.

Open rail
Open rail
Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

What and how we regulate
The Office of Rail Regulation is
  the independent regulator for Britain's rail industry.
We are the economic regulator for railway infrastructure (Network Rail and HS1); the health and safety regulator for the rail industry as a whole – including mainline, metro, tramways and heritage railways across Britain; and the industry's consumer and competition authority.

Health and safety
Health and safety
It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.
Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,
  as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.
How to report an incident

Our health and safety strategy
Our approach to regulating the health and safety risks created and managed by businesses in the rail industry.
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 (HS1) Ltd has a 30-year concession to operate and manage the railway between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel.
As the economic and safety regulator for HS1 Ltd, we require the company to be efficient and perform well.
Competition and consumers
Competition and consumers
We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers.
We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.

Track access
Track access
We make sure the passenger and freight train operating companies have fair access to the rail network – and that best use is made of capacity.
If a railway operator wants to access the railway network, they have to apply to us for a track access agreement with Network Rail.
Station and depot access
Station and depot access
We regulate access to station and light maintenance depots by approving station and depot access agreements.
Our role in approving access agreements helps to ensure that the contractual terms for access to a station or depot are fair to the parties concerned, as well as to users of railway services.
Licensing
Licensing
Licensing is one of our core statutory functions. If you want to operate a train, station, network or light maintenance depot you will need to be covered by a licence or licence exemption.
Through licensing we promote effective and efficient working relationships between industry parties and safeguarding the public interest.

Investing in the industry
This page outlines ORR's investment framework and guidance for investing in the railway.
The consolidated policy and guidelines (below) set out the legislation and processes for anyone who wishes to invest in the rail industry. We are currently reviewing this document in light of recent changes in the rail industry, particularly the reclassification of Network Rail's debt, and will publish a revised version once we have done this.
We have updated Network Rail's rate of return in our periodic review 2013 (PR13) determination for control period 5 (CP5), which will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019. The revised rate of return for CP5 is 4.93% on an annual basis (and 4.81% on a semi-annual basis). We are reviewing the example calculation of a facility charge spreadsheet and if necessary, we will update it and publish this on this webpage.
Investment is essential to cater for the growth in demand for both passenger and freight services. An effective framework for delivering infrastructure investments such as increasing track capacity or building new stations is required.
We have a role in making sure the investment infrastructures are in place, and once agreed, projects are delivered on time and budget.
Schemes are proposed by train operators, other rail users (in particular users of freight services) or funders of rail services. Others are identified by Network Rail in its role of managing the long term planning process for the railway network.
Network Rail also takes the lead in promoting, planning, facilitating and, in most cases, delivering and financing schemes.

Open rail
Our Open rail section aims to provide clear information about railway funding and how the industry is performing.
For details of which fare types are regulated, please see the Strategic Rail Authority's Fares Review Conclusions 2003 pdf icon PDF, 808 Kb .
As such, the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise is capped at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a maximum of 6%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. RPI was 3.2% (in July 2012) when the limits were set for this year, so the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2%, and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 9.2%.
There are three exceptions to this:
Merseyrail's concession agreement with the local Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) limits regulated fares to an average increase of RPI (no plus addition).
Northern Rail's agreement with West Yorkshire PTE limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 8%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 3%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 6.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 11.2%.
Southern's franchise agreement limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 3%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 6.2%.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answers on this topic.
If, after reading our guide you still think that we should look at your fare, go to our guidance on how to make a complaint under competition law pdf icon PDF, 47 Kb .
Penalty fares
We have no role in relation to penalty fares. Rules concerning penalty fares are set out in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) .
Train companies will have their own penalty fares scheme. These schemes are approved by the Department for Transport .
If you have been charged a penalty fare and wish to appeal against it, you should contact the relevant train operating company and use its appeal system.
You may also consider seeking advice from Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
Station car park charges
Prices at station car parks are not regulated.
The decision to charge for car parking at a station and, if so, at what level is a commercial decision for the station operator, as it is for any other commercial car parking provider.
If you have concerns about the price of parking at a train station, your first step should be to contact the station operator and voice those concerns.
We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken.
If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answer on this topic.

Service disruption
Service disruption
This page provides information about who to contact in case of disruption to your train service due to adverse weather or engineering works.
Service disruption due to adverse weather
You should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Most complaints can be resolved in the first instance by dealing directly with the company responsible.
If you have made a complaint to a train operator, and are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact either Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch for help.
Service disruption due to engineering works
If you have a complaint regarding service disruption due to engineering work you should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Please follow the procedure above for further complaints.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the rail network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. This work is usually carried out at weekends, or weekdays during the early hours of the morning so that disruption to services is kept to a minimum. In most cases the work is planned many weeks in advance, and notices are displayed in relevant stations giving passengers advance notification of the disruption.
However, sometimes emergency engineering work may need to be carried out at short notice to rectify an infrastructure fault that may endanger the safe running of trains – for example in the case of a broken rail. In these circumstances no advance notification can be given.

These changes enable us to take enforcement action if required to resolve any serious issues.
Further information
Passengers with disabilities
Passengers with disabilities
All licensed train and station operators are required to establish and comply with a Disabled People's Protection Policy (DPPP) which sets out how they will protect the interests of disabled users of their trains and stations.
Making Rail Accessible: ORR's role in enforcing disabled people's protection policies (DPPPs)
We are responsible for making sure that train and station operators have policies and practices in place that protect the interests of older and disabled passengers. We want to use this role to help empower passengers to make confident journeys.
Each train operator produces a booklet called "Making Rail Accessible: Helping older and disabled people". These booklets are available from stations and the websites of individual operators and they explain what additional assistance disabled people can expect to receive to help them when travelling by train. For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
The assistance offered by each operator may vary slightly. However all operators must as a minimum provide the assistance set out below.
If you would like further information on our role in monitoring and enforcing the DPPPs, please see our policy page .
Passenger Assist
Passenger Assist is a service provided by train companies to disabled passengers and others who require assistance with any part of their train journey.
Staff can help you plan your journey, book tickets and make reservations; they can also assist you at stations and on board trains, with anything from changing platforms to finding your seat.
Passenger Assistance is free and available to anyone who needs assistance due to a disability, temporary impairment, or older age. No railcard is required. For more information ask at your local station or visit the website of your local train operator.
Ramps
Operators must provide ramps that are fit for purpose, available at all staffed stations (either at the station or on board the train) to facilitate the boarding or leaving of the train by wheelchair users, whether assistance has been booked in advance or not.
Where this assistance is needed at an unstaffed station, you will need to book it in advance through Passenger Assist. The operator must ensure that they make a member of staff with a ramp available to deliver the assistance.
Alternative accessible transport
Operators must provide, without extra charge, an appropriate alternative accessible service to take disabled passengers to the nearest or most convenient accessible station from where they can continue their journey.
This duty applies where:
the station is inaccessible;
where, for whatever reason, substitute transport is provided to replace rail services (eg because of planned engineering works) that is inaccessible to disabled passengers;
where there is disruption to services at short notice that, for whatever reason, makes services inaccessible to disabled passengers.
Passenger Information
Operators must provide up-to-date information about the accessibility of facilities and services at stations and on their trains on the National Rail Enquiries website, including the Station Journey Planner ('Stations Made Easy'), as well as their own website.
Tickets and fares
Operators must ensure that, where disabled passengers are unable to buy a ticket at a station before their journey, they are able to buy a ticket without penalty on the train or at their destination.
Scooter Carriage
Operators must state in their DPPP their policy regarding the carriage of scooters for mobility-impaired people on their trains. Operators are expected to make the reasoning behind their policy clear in the DPPP, particularly with regard to any policy excluding the carriage of some or all mobility scooters.
Where operators do carry scooters on trains, it is recommended that operators clearly indicate whether passengers are required to transfer to a seat, rather than remain seated on their scooter while on board the train.
Aural and visual information
Operators should give details in their DPPP of their policies for the provision of aural and visual information at stations. This must include a commitment to providing, wherever possible, clear and consistent aural and visual information of train departures and other relevant messages, particularly in the event of delays or disruption.
Information points and displays
Disabled passengers should be able to get all the information they need at a station from one source. Sections A2 and B1 of Accessible train and station design for disabled people provide standards and guidance for information provision.
Luggage
Luggage can be difficult to manage for many disabled people, and operators must ensure that staff will be available to help where this assistance has been arranged in advance (for example through Passenger Assist).
For further information, and to book assistance, please contact your train operator, or see the website disability-onboard.co.uk , which is operated by the Association of Train Operating companies.
High speed rail (HS2) is a project run by the Department for Transport (DfT).
High speed rail (HS2)
Following a consultation by the DfT, the Government has decided to proceed with the development of a new high speed rail network in the UK, with a first phase between London and the West Midlands.
Further information is available on the DfT website .
Complaints
Complaints
If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond.
Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available.
How to contact the relevant train company
You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments).
Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint.
What happens if you are not happy with the response you get?
If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.
What are my rights as a rail passenger?
The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey.
Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website.
You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website.
Health and safety complaints
Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member.
If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request
Complaints about Network Rail
You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry .
Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public.
If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team .
Competition complaints
We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector.
The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition.
Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty.
Read more information about the Competition Act .

Train driver receives prison sentence for ignoring safety systems
Former First Capital Connect train driver, Scott Walford, has received a three-month suspended prison sentence and been ordered to pay costs of £500, after he ignored warnings and safety systems on the Cambridge to London train he was driving – placing passengers and staff on board in great danger. On 7 November, Mr Walford pleaded guilty following a prosecution brought by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for a breach in health and safety law in October 2013.
New ORR data shows passenger journeys at record high

Open rail
Open rail
Rail
 is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to 
understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying 
passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public 
money. It provides a vital public service with significant social 
benefit.
Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding
and how the industry is performing.
Railway funding in Britain
Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

What and how we regulate
The Office of Rail Regulation is
  the independent regulator for Britain's rail industry.
We are the economic regulator for railway infrastructure (Network Rail and HS1); the health and safety regulator for the rail industry as a whole – including mainline, metro, tramways and heritage railways across Britain; and the industry's consumer and competition authority.

Health and safety
Health and safety
It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.
Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,
  as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.
How to report an incident

Our health and safety strategy
Our approach to regulating the health and safety risks created and managed by businesses in the rail industry.
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail regulation
Network Rail is the monopoly owner and operator of the railway network, including track, signalling, bridges, tunnels and stations. We regulate Network Rail's stewardship of the rail network for the long term – for investors, train companies and their passengers, freight customers and the taxpayer.
We hold Network Rail to account for delivering what it promised – at the amount it agreed to do it for – and we require it to provide passengers with a punctual, reliable service.
Periodic review 2013 (PR13)
At the heart of the review is our assessment of what Network Rail must achieve from 2014 to 2019, the money it needs to do so, and the incentives needed to encourage delivery and outperformance.
Competition and consumers
Competition and consumers
We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers.
We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.

PIM
The Train Accident Precursor Indicator Model (the PIM) managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), measures the risk, per million train miles, of a train accident - i.e. collision, derailment, fire or striking a road vehicle on a level crossing. The measure incorporates 82 precursor events
  in eight groups. Around 65% of the risk arises from events largely under the control or the responsibility of Network Rail, e.g. track geometry, infrastructure failures, environmental factors (flooding, land slips etc.) and level crossing misuse.
The PIM risk indicator was set to a reference value of 100 at the end of March 2002 and the PIM risk indicator provides a measure of the change in risk relative to this level. A reduction in the index is therefore beneficial, denoting a reduction in risk.
Plain line
Track that does not have any junctions, crossovers or points on it.
Points failure
A fault within a set of points (switches and crossings).
Possession disruption index (PDI)
'Possession disruption index – passenger' (PDI-P) and 'Possession disruption index – freight (PDI-F)': a graph indicating the level of disruption caused by possessions over a period of time.
Network Rail needs to restrict access to the network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities.
These restrictions of access are referred to as possessions. Possessions are considered to be 'disruptive' if they impact on the running of passenger or freight operators' normal timetabled services.
Possessions
Network Rail needs to restrict access to its network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. These restrictions of access are referred to as possessions.
Possessions returns
The time by which Network Rail has completed its maintenance and renewals activities and train operators can resume their use of the network to operate their services.
PR08
The periodic review 2008 or PR08 was our assessment of the outputs that Network Rail (who manages the rail infrastructure in Great Britain) must deliver, and the levels of access charges paid by train operators for use of the infrastructure. It covers the five years running from April 2009 to March

The National Rail Trends (NRT) Portal provides access to up-to-date statistics held by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). Registration is free and simple, and provides access to all content and functionality of the NRT portal. Register now to create your own reports.
We are conducting a small survey on the quarterly and annual statistical releases and the quality reports we now produce. Your feedback will tell us how you have found these in the last year, help us with making further improvements and aim to give you the information that you need. Here is the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/statsreleases_qualreports . It should take about 5-10 minutes and closing date is Friday 16th January 2015. Thank you.
Following user feedback, we are in the process of adding reference numbers to tabular data which is published on the portal for the Report Wizard and Data Portal reports.  This process will be taking place over a time period and will be done on a category by category basis.  This means that some reports will have table numbers sooner than others.
Owing to data supply issues, we are unable to publish the 2013-14 annual data for the impact of freight on road haulage and the market share for rail freight. We are working with our data suppliers and shall provide an update on timescales on the data portal as soon as we have more information.  ORR apologises for any inconvenience this may cause.
Precursor Indicator Model Publication
The Railway Safety Standard Board's (RSSB) Precursor Indicator Model (PIM) has been published on the ORR Data Portal since 9th May 2011.  RSSB have now taken the decision to publish the raw data on their website.   To avoid duplication of effort, the ORR has decided to withdraw this publication from the ORR Data Portal.  For further details concerning this change, please review the further information page of the portal.
For any further information, please contact the statistics Head of Profession, Fazilat Dar at rstats@orr.gsi.gov.uk on 0207 282 3705.
As part of our commitment to improving the quality of our statistics in line with requirements for National Statistics accreditation, we introduced themed statistical releases in the latter part of 2013. These will provide contextual commentary on statistics across a common topic (e.g. rail usage) and will aid the user in the interpretation of the data. This means that we will no longer be producing the quarterly summary in its current form, with quarter 4 2012-13 (Jan – Mar 2013) being the last one. Please contact us at rail.stats@orr.gsi.gov.uk for more information.
The data wizard reports relating to service satisfaction have been removed from the Data Portal as many of them are due to be revised.  Alternative service satisfaction data may be viewed in the form of pre-created reports at service satisfaction reports .
There are some changes to the following publications.
Rail Market Share

RSS Feeds
RSS Feeds
The Office of Rail Regulation website uses a free newsfeed so you can stay up to date with our latest Publications, Press Notices and Consultations.
What is RSS?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for distributing news content and is a simple way to keep up to date with the latest news on a website without having to visit the site.
Websites publish via RSS and then individuals or other websites automatically get the updated content via a 'news aggregator' or 'news reader'. Typically, an item in an RSS feed will only contain a title, excerpt or description, and link back to the original, more detailed content.
News aggregators or news readers
If you want to receive RSS you will need a news reader. Some you can access using a browser, and some are applications that need to be downloaded onto your computer. There is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time.

Different news readers work on different operating systems, so you will need to take this into account when you make your choice.
A list of news readers include:

Toolkits
YJB toolkits have been developed following requests from Youth Justice Partnerships for quick and easy access to performance improvement resources.
The toolkits, developed following direct work with services across England and Wales, enable YOTs to identify and address areas of under-achievement, risk or change. They are designed to help YOTs:
arrive at a clear understanding of the causes & contributory factors
choose from a range of potential solutions which can be tailored to local circumstances,
learn from the best practice available.
The toolkits can either be used in full or ‘dipped in to’ by using the Materials Library. The toolkits have all been produced using the same format. If this is your first time using one, we’d recommend reading the Toolkit Introduction which provides further details on how to use them.
Toolkit Introduction (PPT 2.2mb)
Each toolkit has been developed through close work with with YOTs, however it is our aim to revise and improve the toolkits on an ongoing basis and we would appreciate your feedback in order to help us with this ongoing development work. (see the link at the end of each toolkit’s introductory slide pack).
Contact your YJB Wales/Regional Team if you have any quieries or suggestions.
The full list of toolkits and their products is set out below. All contents are stored in the folders, apart from the ‘interactive data tools’ which are located on YJMIS.
The introductory slide pack has full details on how to access YJMIS. At present the tools need to be manually populated. The next phase of the work will explore uploading significant portions of data directly from MIS.
