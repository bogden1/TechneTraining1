Accessing the Justice Data Lab service From: Information provided to organisations supporting the rehabilitation of offenders. Documents PDF , 353KB, 44 pages Detail The Justice Data Lab pilot gives organisations working with offenders access to central reoffending data. The service provides this information to help organisations to assess the impact of their work on reducing reoffending. It also helps develop a collaborative understanding of effective rehabilitation. To use the service, complete the ‘data upload template’ with details of the individuals your organisation has worked with, and information about the services provided. The template must be sent by secure email (gsi or CJSM). If the information in the ‘data upload template’ meets the minimum criteria, the Justice Data Lab will provide an analysis which assesses the impact of that programme against various reoffending measures (including the 1 year proven reoffending rate and the frequency of reoffending over the 1 year). The results will be returned in a clear and easy to understand format, with explanations of the key metrics, and any caveats and limitations needed to interpret the results. See all results published so far at: Justice Data Lab pilot statistics reports Update on the Justice Data Lab service – October 2014 The Justice Data Lab team have started bringing the 2012 reoffending data into the service. You can now submit information on the individuals you were working with during 2012, in addition to the years 2002 to 2011. The Justice Data Lab has made a commitment to bringing underlying reoffending data into the service more regularly. If you have any questions about the latest available data email a member of the team. Published:

Bills and legislation Issue Any amount of crime in society is unacceptable. Not just because of the human cost, but also the cost to society. Actions We have a new approach to fighting crime that involves a shift of power from Whitehall to local communities. The police will be given far greater freedom to do their jobs, and the public more power to hold them to account. We will judge our success on whether crime has fallen. We’re reducing crime by: creating community triggers to deal with persistent antisocial behaviour using community safety partnerships and police and crime commissioners, to work out local approaches to deal with issues, including antisocial behaviour, drug or alcohol misuse and re-offending establishing the national referral mechanism to make it easier for all the different agencies that could be involved in a trafficking case to cooperate, share information about potential victims and get access to advice, accommodation and support creating street-level crime maps to give the public up-to-date, accurate information on what is happening on their streets so they can challenge the police on performance And we’re trying to prevent crime by: creating the child sex offender disclosure scheme , which allows anyone concerned about a child to find out if someone in their life has a record for child sexual offences legislating against hate crime using football banning orders to stop potential troublemakers from travelling to football matches - both at home and abroad legislating to stop cash payments to buy scrap metal and reforming the regulation of the scrap metal industry to prevent unscrupulous dealers buying stolen metal Background Our new approach to fighting crime is informed by, among others, the following: ‘A new approach to fighting crime’ (March 2011) - the police and their partners will be given far greater freedom to do their jobs and use their discretion ‘Putting victims first: more effective responses to anti-social behaviour’ (May 2012) - this white paper sets out our plans to introduce more effective measures to tackle antisocial behaviour Community Remedy consultation (December 2012) - this consultation asked for views on proposals to introduce legislation to allow police and crime commissioners (or the relevant local policing body) to give victims of low-level crime (such as low-level criminal damage and low-value thefts) and antisocial behaviour a say in the punishment of the offender Bills and legislation The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act received royal assent in March 2014. The act has introduced simpler, more effective powers to tackle anti-social behaviour and better protection for victims and communities, including : tackling the use of illegal firearms by gangs and organised criminal groups stopping irresponsible dog ownership strengthening the protection afforded to the victims of forced marriage and those at risk of sexual harm amending the port and border security powers in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000 Published:

Menu ≡ Tax Tribunal guidance First–tier Tribunal (Tax) hears appeals against decisions relating to tax made by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Appeals can be made by individuals or organisations, single tax payers or large multi-national companies. Appeals range from the relatively simple to the complex across both direct and indirect tax. Direct tax is a tax that is usually levied directly on an individual or organisation, such as income tax or corporation tax. Indirect tax refers to tax that is usually levied on goods or services rather than on an individual or organisation, such as VAT or Customs Duty. This website provides information about the Tax Chamber's rules and procedures and gives guidance on how to appeal. Appeals against HMRC decisions in relation to tax heard in the Tax Chamber include: Income Tax National Insurance Contributions Statutory Payments VAT or duties such as custom duties, excise duties or landfill tax, aggregates or climate change levies The amounts of tax or duty to be paid, against penalties imposed upon them and against certain other decisions. Please note that appeals against decisions in relation to tax credits are heard by the First-tier Tribunal (Social Security and Child Support) . About us The Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal was established on 1 April 2009. It replaces the four former separate Tax Tribunals, namely: the General Commissioners; VAT & Duties; and Section 706 Tribunals. The Tax Chamber is independent of HMRC and hears most appeals against decision of HMRC in relation to tax. The onward appeal from the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) is to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery). Appeals are heard by panels that are constituted according to the needs of the case, and may be heard by legally qualified Judges, non-legally qualified expert Members or a mix of the two. The jurisdiction of the tax tribunal is UK-wide, and hearings are held inTribunal Service venues across the United Kingdom. What you can expect from us When dealing with a matter before the First-tier Tribunal (Tax), we will; deal with correspondence within five working days of receiving it; register new appeals and references within 10 working days of receiving them; send decisions to parties of the appeal within five working days of signature by the Judge. The Judge will sign (but not date) the decision once it has been agreed. This can typically be about one or two months after the last day of hearing. The decision will bear the date that it is formally released to the parties of the appeal; and send decisions to public subscribers (individuals, or organisations, who are not directly associated with the appeal and have requested a copy of the decision) within 10 working days of informing the parties of the outcome of the appeal Updated: Friday, 12 September 2014 Contact

Menu ≡ About the Independent Monitoring Board Inside every prison, immigration removal centre and some short term holding facilities at airports, there is an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) – a group of ordinary members of the public doing an extraordinary job. IMB members are independent, unpaid and work an average of 2-3 days per month. Their role is to monitor the day-to-day life in their local prison or removal centre and ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained. Members have unrestricted access to their local prison or immigration detention centre at any time and can talk to any prisoner or detainee they wish to, out of sight and hearing of a members of staff if necessary. A typical monitoring visit, for example, might include time spent in the kitchens, workshops, accommodation blocks, recreation areas, healthcare centre and chaplaincy. Board members also play an important role in dealing with problems inside the establishment. If a prisoner or detainee has an issue that he or she has been unable to resolve through the usual internal channels, he or she can put in a confidential request to see a member of the IMB. Problems might include concerns over lost property, visits from family or friends, special religious or cultural requirements, or even serious allegations such as bullying. If something serious happens at the establishment, for example a riot or a death in custody, representatives of the board may be called in to attend and observe the way in which the situation is handled.

Menu ≡ Toolkits YJB toolkits have been developed following requests from Youth Justice Partnerships for quick and easy access to performance improvement resources. The toolkits, developed following direct work with services across England and Wales, enable YOTs to identify and address areas of under-achievement, risk or change. They are designed to help YOTs: arrive at a clear understanding of the causes & contributory factors choose from a range of potential solutions which can be tailored to local circumstances, learn from the best practice available. The toolkits can either be used in full or ‘dipped in to’ by using the Materials Library. The toolkits have all been produced using the same format. If this is your first time using one, we’d recommend reading the Toolkit Introduction which provides further details on how to use them. Toolkit Introduction (PPT 2.2mb) Each toolkit has been developed through close work with with YOTs, however it is our aim to revise and improve the toolkits on an ongoing basis and we would appreciate your feedback in order to help us with this ongoing development work. (see the link at the end of each toolkit’s introductory slide pack). Contact your YJB Wales/Regional Team if you have any quieries or suggestions. The full list of toolkits and their products is set out below. All contents are stored in the folders, apart from the ‘interactive data tools’ which are located on YJMIS. The introductory slide pack has full details on how to access YJMIS. At present the tools need to be manually populated. The next phase of the work will explore uploading significant portions of data directly from MIS. 
Menu ≡ Transforming rehabilitation Transforming Rehabilitation is a reform programme that is changing the way offenders are managed in the community to bring down reoffending rates while continuing to protect the public. Our reforms will: Open up the market to a diverse range of rehabilitation providers from the private, voluntary and social sectors (including potential mutuals); Incentivise innovation, paying providers by results for delivering reductions in reoffending; Extend statutory rehabilitation to 45,000 short sentenced offenders released from prison every year, who have the highest reoffending rates and yet currently receive no supervision after release; Reorganise our prisons to resettle offenders ‘through the gate’, with continuous support from custody to community; Create a new public sector National Probation Service, to manage high risk offenders. You can sign up to receive updates about Transforming Rehabilitation. Full details of the reform plans are set out in the government’s consultation response Transforming Rehabilitation: A Strategy for Reform . Transforming Rehabilitation is driven by the Ministry of Justice and Home Office’s Reducing reoffending and improving rehabilitation policy . Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 On 13 March 2014, the Offender Rehabilitation Bill received Royal Assent. The new Act means that for the first time virtually all offenders will receive at least 12 months supervision in the community on release from custody. The provisions in the Act will be implemented as part of the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms. The Act and explanatory notes can be downloaded from the UK Parliament website. Supporting documentation including the impact assessment is on the gov.uk website. Updated: Wednesday, 29 October 2014 Contact

9. Search for probate records 1. Overview When someone dies, you may be able to apply for a ‘grant of representation’. This gives you the legal right to deal with the person’s property, money and possessions (their ‘estate’) - known as ‘probate’. You can apply yourself or use a solicitor. Most cases follow the same basic process. Check if there’s a will - this normally states who sorts out the estate. If there’s no will the next of kin can apply. Apply to get a ‘grant of representation’ - this gives you the legal right to access things like the person’s bank account. Pay Inheritance Tax if the estate’s worth over £325,000 and is part of applying for a grant of representation - once you’ve paid any tax due, you can collect the assets. Collect the assets, eg money from the sale of the person’s property. Pay any debts, eg unpaid utilities bills. Distribute the estate - this means giving any property, money or possessions to the people entitled to it (‘beneficiaries’). A grant of representation can sometimes be known as a ‘grant of probate’, ‘letters of administration’ or ‘letters of administration with a will’. When a grant of representation may not be needed You don’t normally need a grant if the estate either: passes to the surviving spouse/civil partner because it was held in joint names , eg a savings account this doesn’t include land, property or shares You should contact the organisation holding the money, eg the bank or building society. They may ask for proof of death, eg the death certificate after the death has been registered . Each financial institution has its own rules - you may still need to apply for a grant.

Menu ≡ Special Educational Needs and Disability From 1 September 2014 the process of assessing the needs and making educational provision for children with special educational needs will start to change. Children and young people from 0 – 25 years can pursue appeals in the Tribunal and young people over the statutory school age of 16 can appeal in their own right, rather than through their parents. New requests to local authorities for an education, health and care assessment will follow the new legislation Children and Families Act 2014 . Children and young people who already have a statement of special educational needs maintained by their local authority, will see a gradual transition into the new arrangements. Until the new system is fully implemented, there will be different legal considerations by the tribunal depending on whether the appeal involves a statement or an EHC plan. To help you with the process, different forms are being used and different versions of the guidance are available depending on the type of appeal. Updated: Thursday, 4 September 2014 Contact
