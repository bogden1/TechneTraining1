For details of which fare types are regulated, please see the Strategic Rail Authority's Fares Review Conclusions 2003 pdf icon PDF, 808 Kb . As such, the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise is capped at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus a maximum of 6%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. RPI was 3.2% (in July 2012) when the limits were set for this year, so the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2%, and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 9.2%. There are three exceptions to this: Merseyrail's concession agreement with the local Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) limits regulated fares to an average increase of RPI (no plus addition). Northern Rail's agreement with West Yorkshire PTE limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 8%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 3%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 6.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 11.2%. Southern's franchise agreement limits the amount by which an individual regulated fare can rise at the RPI plus a maximum of 3%, within a basket of fares that cannot rise by more than RPI plus 1%. So the maximum average increase for the basket is 4.2% and the maximum increase for an individual fare is 6.2%. We enforce the Competition Act 1998, which makes it illegal for companies to do certain things, for example, use their powerful position in the market to take advantage of consumers or fix prices and we may conduct an investigation if we have reasonable grounds to suspect the law has been broken. If you think we should look at your fare, please look at our approach to the application of competition law to rail fares and car park charges . It is set out in our web-based guide and our set of quick reference questions and answers on this topic. If, after reading our guide you still think that we should look at your fare, go to our guidance on how to make a complaint under competition law pdf icon PDF, 47 Kb . Penalty fares We have no role in relation to penalty fares. Rules concerning penalty fares are set out in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) . Train companies will have their own penalty fares scheme. These schemes are approved by the Department for Transport . If you have been charged a penalty fare and wish to appeal against it, you should contact the relevant train operating company and use its appeal system. You may also consider seeking advice from Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer.

Britain now has one of the safest railways in Europe – for passengers and for workers, but we cannot be complacent. There is always more the industry can do to improve this country's health and safety record even further. We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,   as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector. How to report an incident Find out how to report an incident under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013. Find out more about RIDDOR Our health and safety strategy Our approach to regulating the health and safety risks created and managed by businesses in the rail industry. 
Complaints Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond. Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available. How to contact the relevant train company You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments). Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint. What happens if you are not happy with the response you get? If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer. What are my rights as a rail passenger? The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey. Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website. You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website. Health and safety complaints Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member. If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request Complaints about Network Rail You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry . Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public. If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team . Competition complaints We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector. The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition. Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty. Read more information about the Competition Act . Complaints about us Our Customer correspondence team (CCT) Our customer correspondence team handle all complaints that come to us. Last updated - 31 October 2014 
Station and depot access Station and depot access We regulate access to station and light maintenance depots by approving station and depot access agreements. Our role in approving access agreements helps to ensure that the contractual terms for access to a station or depot are fair to the parties concerned, as well as to users of railway services. 
Competition and consumers Competition and consumers We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers. We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK.

Investing in the industry This page outlines ORR's investment framework and guidance for investing in the railway. The consolidated policy and guidelines (below) set out the legislation and processes for anyone who wishes to invest in the rail industry. We are currently reviewing this document in light of recent changes in the rail industry, particularly the reclassification of Network Rail's debt, and will publish a revised version once we have done this. We have updated Network Rail's rate of return in our periodic review 2013 (PR13) determination for control period 5 (CP5), which will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019. The revised rate of return for CP5 is 4.93% on an annual basis (and 4.81% on a semi-annual basis). We are reviewing the example calculation of a facility charge spreadsheet and if necessary, we will update it and publish this on this webpage. Investment is essential to cater for the growth in demand for both passenger and freight services. An effective framework for delivering infrastructure investments such as increasing track capacity or building new stations is required. We have a role in making sure the investment infrastructures are in place, and once agreed, projects are delivered on time and budget. Schemes are proposed by train operators, other rail users (in particular users of freight services) or funders of rail services. Others are identified by Network Rail in its role of managing the long term planning process for the railway network. Network Rail also takes the lead in promoting, planning, facilitating and, in most cases, delivering and financing schemes. Current investment framework policy and guidance

Complaints Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your experience when buying a ticket or travelling by rail, you should contact the relevant train company first, to give it the opportunity to respond. Separate information on complaints about the price of your train ticket or station car park is available. How to contact the relevant train company You can find a list of train companies on the National Rail Enquiry website , or you can phone National Rail Enquiries on: 08457 48 49 50 or National Rail Enquiries Textphone: 0845 60 50 600 (for customers with hearing impairments). Before contacting the train company, you might like to look at the websites of Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch , as their frequently asked questions and advice pages contain useful information that may help you when making a complaint. What happens if you are not happy with the response you get? If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from the train operating company or retailer, you can contact Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch, as appropriate, who may be able to assist you further. You should note that they cannot take up your complaint until you have contacted the relevant train company and given it a chance to respond first, and you should enclose all previous correspondence with the train company/retailer. What are my rights as a rail passenger? The National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) set out your rights when travelling by rail on the National Rail Network. If you are travelling to Europe by rail, please check with the company if other terms apply to the international part of your journey. Individual train companies may give you more extensive rights than those set out in the NRCoC. These may be found in the relevant train company's Passenger's Charter or other publications. The relevant train company will be able to advise you of these, or you can often find them on its website. You should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the ticket type you are using – Anytime, Off-Peak or Advance – as these vary. Details of these ticket types and their terms and conditions can be found on the National Rail website. Health and safety complaints Complaints regarding health and safety on the railways can be sent to our customer correspondence team , which will forward your complaint to the relevant railway safety team member. If you are a railway company employee and have a health and safety complaint that has not been successful with your manager, with the unions or with CIRAS , you may contact us and we will forward your complaint to the appropriate railway safety team member. Your confidentiality will be protected if you so request Complaints about Network Rail You should try to resolve your complaint with Network Rail in the first instance. However we provide information on what Network Rail are responsible for and how you can make an complaint or enquiry . Please note that Network Rail's licence is deliberately designed so that our regulatory controls are at a high level, rather than at ground level. Because of this we are unlikely to be able to intervene in many individual complaints from members of the public. If, however, there is an issue that you feel we should be made aware of, you are welcome to submit your concerns to our customer correspondence team . Competition complaints We enforce the Competition Act 1998 in the railway sector. The Competition Act outlaws any agreements, business practices or conduct which has, or could have, a damaging effect on competition in the United Kingdom. This includes abuse by a company which uses its dominant position in a way that damages competition. Where conduct has an effect on trade between member states we will apply Articles 101 and 102 of the European Treaty. Read more information about the Competition Act . Complaints about us Our Customer correspondence team (CCT) Our customer correspondence team handle all complaints that come to us. Last updated - 31 October 2014

Open rail Open rail Rail  is a complex industry and its finances and operations are difficult to  understand. Although 60% of rail finances come from fare-paying  passengers, the industry still receives significant sums of public  money. It provides a vital public service with significant social  benefit. Open rail aims to provide clear information about railway funding and how the industry is performing. Railway funding in Britain Funding for Network Rail and the train and freight operating companies comes from a combination of passenger fares, government subsidy and commercial operations.

Service disruption Service disruption This page provides information about who to contact in case of disruption to your train service due to adverse weather or engineering works. Service disruption due to adverse weather You should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Most complaints can be resolved in the first instance by dealing directly with the company responsible. If you have made a complaint to a train operator, and are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact either Passenger Focus or London TravelWatch for help. Service disruption due to engineering works If you have a complaint regarding service disruption due to engineering work you should first contact the relevant train operating company directly to allow it the opportunity to address your concerns. Please follow the procedure above for further complaints. Network Rail needs to restrict access to the rail network to carry out many of its maintenance and renewals activities. This work is usually carried out at weekends, or weekdays during the early hours of the morning so that disruption to services is kept to a minimum. In most cases the work is planned many weeks in advance, and notices are displayed in relevant stations giving passengers advance notification of the disruption. However, sometimes emergency engineering work may need to be carried out at short notice to rectify an infrastructure fault that may endanger the safe running of trains – for example in the case of a broken rail. In these circumstances no advance notification can be given. 
Competition and consumers Competition and consumers We work to ensure that the rail market is competitive and fair – for passengers, freight customers, railway operators and taxpayers. We have powers under both consumer and competition law with regard to the railways. Consumer law aims to ensure that businesses are fair and open in their dealings with consumers. Competition law outlaws any agreements, business practices or actions which have a damaging effect on competition in the UK. 
Health and safety Health and safety It's our responsibility to ensure that those responsible make Britain's railways safe for passengers and provide a safe place for staff to work.

We regulate health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain,   as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector.
