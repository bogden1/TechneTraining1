Consultation on the Conduct, Marking and Grading of Spoken Language Skills in GCSE English Language Consultations > Consultation on the Conduct, Marking and Grading of Spoken Language Skills in GCSE English Language Home Back The scope of this consultation From September 2015, students in England will start studying for new GCSE English language qualifications, graded 9 to 1. We have already announced that the outcomes of the assessment of students' speaking skills will not contribute to the 9 to 1 grade for the subject. This grade will be based on students' performance in their written exams only. Students' performance in their spoken language assessment will instead be reported in a separate grade. We are now seeking views on how the spoken language assessment should be conducted, marked and graded.
